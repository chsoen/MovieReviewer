I liked the first one but didn't really know everything that was going on, but just knowing that she set off the kill 5 individuals who left her dead at her wedding. So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions. I recommend Kill Bill Vol. 2.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

After 35+ years, the show still holds up well. Each show featured an American actor in the lead with British supporting players. Some of my favorite actors in the series included George Maharis, formerly of Route 66, and Barbara Jefford, a British actress. Ms. Jefford played an evil aunt to a boy made to wear dresses and pose as a girl. It would be great if the series would be released on DVD but I'm afraid it's one of the countless short-run series that are very fondly remembered but will never make it to disc. This would be a great series for Encore Mysteries to run.", "helpful": ["11", "11"]}, {"review_id": "rw1133946", "reviewer": "GreenwheelFan2002", "movie": "The Island (2005)", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Not just about action, but about survival...", "review_date": "24 July 2005", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Once again the critics prove themselves as morons! This movie was definitely the best I've seen this summer and deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. People see the name Michael Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time, but trust me, this one is definitely worth your time and money.I won't comment on specifics of the story because I don't want to spoil it, but as a whole it is very impressive, and tackles many issues that we face in today's society.The acting is great, and Ewan McGregor pulled off his character perfectly. The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half, and the many chase scenes can get frustrating, but the action adds a lot to the movie, and the directing is wonderful.But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal, which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak, and they are depicted wonderfully.Come on people, stop obsessing over the frat comedies, crappy comic-book adaptations, and dumb horror movies, and treat yourself to a good film. Don't pass this one up. GO AND SEE IT NOW!", "helpful": ["2", "5"]},

Won't give it away but you will more than likely be able to figure it out ten minutes into the movie. The only positive thing about the flick are the actors and actressess giving their characters persona and the character Tad Hamilton, since he's actually not JUST a slimeball one-dimensional character but actually a guy who does transform during the coarse of the movie, just like the other two leads.. Kinda cute but by the looks of it it didn't make it all that well at the box office. Looks cheap. 3/10", "helpful": ["2", "3"]},

This anime features a guy and his kid sidekick as they start out as sort of trouble solvers. Being body guards, bounty hunting, name the price and they do it as long as it appears to be on the up and up. Well they take on a mysterious client that turns out to be an outlaw hence the journey into the stars commences. During this trip they find an android who seems almost human, they get into trouble with pirates, they commandeer a ship later named \"The Outlaw Star\", they run afoul of an alien beast woman, they get into trouble with an assassin, and they have many many action packed, but funny adventures on their way to solving the mysterious of something known as the Galactic Leyline. Like I said this series has it all...action, romance, and lots of humor to tickle your funny bone as well. The series starts out fast, stays fast in the middle and doesn't let up till the very end. Having the entire series uncut on DVD is pretty cool too, as the Japanese voices are a lot better especially Aisha Clan Clan who has a bit of an irritating voice in the American version.", "helpful": ["11", "12"]},

I had heard about him a couple of times, but basically knew nothing about this man. So, in a way this film was very educational. I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design, costumes, cinematography, editing, etc, were all at top level. And I especially loved how Scorsese played around with the color filter to resemble the colorized pictures of the time.RATING: 4 STARS (****)", "helpful": ["0", "2"]},

I always feel they're overreacting. Phantom Menace has a few flaws, but is otherwise good. There are only 3 main problems I have. One is explanations. Obviously this movie was made after the OT, but I felt it was supposed to be presented as the first one. A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day. But all three things aren't too bad, and I only wish the IMDb offered 9.5 stars, because I just can't give it a 10. Oh well, a 9 is still an A.", "helpful": ["7", "10"]},

Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them. The true horror here lies in the making of another dismal product supported by Michael Bay and friends.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

Wayne was 35 at the time of Pearl Harbor, and not even his friendship with then-Cdr. John Ford could get him accepted for military service. (according to one bio, his distinctive walk resulted from a football injury.) On one tour of the Pacific, Wayne got dead drunk with some fighter pilots in New Guinea. They placed his inert form on a cot and carried it into the middle of the compound and allowed him to awake with a hangover: stark naked.
