There's not much to this movie at all. I was sucked in by the high rating and overly positive reviews that must have submitted by cast and film crew. I won't give a technical analysis like an ameteur movie critic, just my sincere opinion.The Droving was annoying from the jump due to not being able to hear the opening dialogue over the ambient sounds. At times it was so difficult to hear what was being said, I had to turn on the caption. I knew after that The Droving was starting with a negative balance and really good things had to happen moving forward to win me over.Film is beautiful with many nature scenes. It does not appear to be low budget from that standpoint. It also has a decent pace, so I didn't fall asleep (I was close on occasions). With those things being stated, cinematographer and pace could not save this film and rightfully so!Where the Droving falls apart, is with the story, in my humble opinion. The premise is interesting but the story is not well developed. The main character is almost as much as a mystery as the movie's story itself. The climax is very anticlimactic and evolves rapidly to an abrupt ending that left me scratching my head.Finally, there are worse movies out there than The Droving. It had potential to be a good watch, but missed the mark majorly with story and character development. Background sound made it difficult at times to hear dialogue and ending was a total letdown; making it a film that can be bypassed for most other movie options.", "helpful": ["26", "41"]},

This movie was suppose to stand out from the rest of the Netflix standards.Unfortunately..The writing was horrible. Love is messy but that doesn't mean the writing should be messy too! It seemed like the writer wanted to make a messy love story but forgot to actually focus on the STORY and rather just used quotes that left us with nothing. The characters had no depth and I felt like the writer was trying too hard to make them sound philosophical rather than just being a normal teenager trying to actually find love and not be in a 70 years old mind.\nNeeded another 1h and 40min to cover up all the many and messy parts of the movie.What triggeres me the most is that through out the whole movie the main core is \"WHAT IS LOVE\" where the movie follows how love is messy but actully never focuses on the long journey of it. All of a sudden the movie is rushed to an ending where all of the 3 protagonists finds the \"key\" to love and then knows everything about love after a KISS and some cliche quotes. COMEON. SHOW US THE LIVELIHOOD OF LOVE. Not the vague idea written in books with random quotes about the universe and stars.Of course the soundtrack has to be good just to occopy the teenagers mind to think that the movie is so great even though it's not. 4 stars for acting, soundtrack, editing etc..", "helpful": ["16", "26"]},

Not as many people know about Carne because it's a 35 minute short film, not a feature length film - BUT, his debut feature film I STAND ALONE is actually a direct continuation of what occurs in CARNE. Though I have known about I STAND ALONE since about 2003, I didn't hear about CARNE until this year. I actually think CARNE is superior to I STAND ALONE - because of the short runtime it's paced very quickly and features more of Gaspar's stylish cutting and editing. It is thoroughly entertaining, while I STAND ALONE is more a slow-burning, icky-feeling build to a wretched climax that will make pretty much everyone feel like they need to take a shower afterwards.Any way, this movie is very good. Probably one of the best short films I have ever seen. The singular style is turned up to 10. The performances are on point. And the dialogue, subject matter, and some of the visuals are immensely jarring. Though I STAND ALONE is not a movie I would ever recommend to anyone (because of the sickening subject matter), I suggest that for those who are interested, do not watch I STAND ALONE without seeing CARNE first. They should be watched in sequence, just as one should watch something like KILL BILL Vol. 1 and 2.Now that I've seen all of Gaspar Noe's films... I would rank them in this order...ENTER THE VOID > IRREVERSIBLE > CLIMAX > CARNE > LOVE > I STAND ALONE", "helpful": ["4", "4"]},

Having not been a big fan of the pilot the second episode of Season 1 was better and by the third I wanted to watch more and more with one of the best parts being when you rewatch old episodes it feels like your watching them for the first time again.The characters all fit together in their own way without anyone overplaying their part, they're also hilariously funny & practically all of them are extremely likeable none more so IMO than Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) also additionally I could possibly say that Amy Santiago & Jake Peralta are quite argubaly the best couple to come out of a TV show potentially ever.

Flat, humorless, dialogue aimed probably at the middle school level.\n4. Really bad science to fill people's brains. Besides the faster than light for a biological being (forget the energy demands) was the really dumb ring portal to the opposite side of the Universe.

She is 'courted ' by her friend Sonja (Tereza Srbova) and her brother Leo (Tom Hughes), supporters of the Soviet party, and is convinced to share the information about the making of the bomb with Stalin's Russia - partly because Joan hypothetically believes all powerful countries should have access to the A bomb in order to maintain equality and prevent abuse of the bomb in the manner the US used in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mixed with love affairs and fear Joan transfers the secret information to Soviet Russia, and her secrecy lasts until 1999 when MI5 agents arrest her. The film opens with contemporary time and then flashes back and forth to the 30s and 40s in a manner that makes the story credible.An excellent cast, especially Dench and Cookson, brings this story to life and the impact, whether you agree with the premise or not, makes the film absorbing.

The Sonic movie is definitely better than the Mario movie, although that was years ago. And it's better than the Mario TV show too.Jim Carrey is fantastic is Dr. Robotnik, and I expect him to be even better in the sequel, Sonic is actually likable as a cartoon character, and the rest of the human cast do a fine job supporting him, similar to any Garfield movie.

Even now, amc movie theaters is boycotting Universal Pictures and refusing to carry any of their films as universal enjoyed great success with this strategy and doesn't have to share the hundred million dollars they made on trolls World Tour with anybody.But back to the movie itself. The movie is a delightful children's film about different types of music, and how they can all work together in the end, from rock to pop to classical to funk to rock to... that's about it. but all the different styles of music, a little bit of reggae a little bit of Kpop, some smooth jazz (normal jazz seems to be ignored entirely,\nI guess funk is part of jazz). Anyway all of these different types of music come together in a beautiful story that I think will teach kids about the importance of listening to different types of music. This is a great lesson and a valuable kids movie. Great songs for adults who will recognize a lot of them.

Like a boss is a movie about two female entrepreneurs who have been working together their whole life and how they were nearly ripped apart by Salma Hayek, and her evil plan to rip apart female entrepreneurs who are friends, because she was ripped apart from her female entrepreneur friend (later revealed, spoiler alert to be none other than Phoebe buffet from friends. Lisa Kudrow.)That's about it for the review of the movie. I enjoyed the part where the women kept smoking joints and got in trouble for smoking joints at their friend's house. It was also great to see the dislike thrown upon these single working women from their married pregnant friends. And then the way that dislike quickly morphed into jealousy, later on, when the girls were going through trouble. It's a decent movie, the plot could have been better. It could have made more sense and been more straightforward but it's the slam together gobbly goo that they came up with. at least they didn't force any unnecessary romance on the characters, instead, mainly focusing on the business relationship, and the friendship. Like a boss, a title better than the film. I hope you enjoyed this review. Thank you for reading.", "helpful": ["1", "2"]},

First, it was EXTREMELY hard for me to watch. Now, admittedly, I have a hard time witnessing the depths of stupidity humanity has sprinkled within in. Always have, always will. This runs from flat earthers to religion and beyond. So this self failing negativly impacted my experience watching this. My gut reaction was to rate it much lower, but I know that wouldn't be fair for anyone reading this and thinking about watching it.Second, as for the documentary itself, it was well done in one sense, but misleading in another. Most people going into it will think it's at least in part going to have some decent arguments from the flat earthers to justify their belief. However, the best \"proof\" that was given was \"I can see that building there. If the Earth was round, I shouldn't be able to see it\". Face palm. Instead, 90% of it was aimed at the personalities and mental mindsets of people who consider themselves flat earthers, and fortunately, it doesn't paint them in a very flattering light. The editing was well done, the people included in the documentary were ...... interesting, and the creators did their best to not go out of their way to make the believers look like fools.....that's something they did all on their own, so in a way, it was nice to see the producers and director not pile it on.Bottom line, if you have spare time to kill and witnessing how ridiculous some of your neighbors can be doesn't bother you, it's entertaining enough.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

As someone who doesn't usually watch these types of movies I absolutely loved it and for such a film to get such a stellar cast with names like Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams & Tina Fey. I was pleasantly surprised at how much on screen chemistry there was and it all seemed to just fall into place.Lohan's character Cady is incredibly likeable from the start. A girl who has moved to a new school learning about cliques and the social hierachy. Rachel McAdams does a stunning job playing leader of the 'Plastics' Regina George where she's just catty enough to be seen as sort of an antagonist but not too much that it ruins the aesthetic of the film & a mention must be given to Amanda Seyfried for the brilliantly talented acting of the character Karen (your typical pretty but also pretty thick girl) all this with Fey's writing and good humoured portrayal of teacher Ms. Norbury and it's easy to see why this movie has helped launch careers of these actors and actresses (specifically Lohan)Having said that I would like to have seen the original characters stay or go back for a second movie without the need to potentially almost rush an ending like they did with Cady, Karen, Regina & Gretchen. It's like if they were to keep that ending but for the end of a second movie and have new events leading up to that.Overall though, a thoroughly enjoyable movie that made me laugh and had me rooting for Cady from almost the very beginning. Totally recommend and would watch again (over and over possibly)", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

And, that's not to mention what he says about the native \"indian\" in the final few minutes, (plus what he does with another earlier in it. So, as a movie about the arrogance of Europeans and their dominance decades if not a century before US dominance, this was an enjoyable experience.But, I doubt that's what they had in mind when they made the movie. I'm guessing it was yet another whiny attempt to whine about America and what they did (which was horrible by the way- United Fruit Company), and if it was, boy did they get it completely wrong by not hiring a Brazilian \"indian\" to be head bad-guy.
