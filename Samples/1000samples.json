There's not much to this movie at all. I was sucked in by the high rating and overly positive reviews that must have submitted by cast and film crew. I won't give a technical analysis like an ameteur movie critic, just my sincere opinion.The Droving was annoying from the jump due to not being able to hear the opening dialogue over the ambient sounds. At times it was so difficult to hear what was being said, I had to turn on the caption. I knew after that The Droving was starting with a negative balance and really good things had to happen moving forward to win me over.Film is beautiful with many nature scenes. It does not appear to be low budget from that standpoint. It also has a decent pace, so I didn't fall asleep (I was close on occasions). With those things being stated, cinematographer and pace could not save this film and rightfully so!Where the Droving falls apart, is with the story, in my humble opinion. The premise is interesting but the story is not well developed. The main character is almost as much as a mystery as the movie's story itself. The climax is very anticlimactic and evolves rapidly to an abrupt ending that left me scratching my head.Finally, there are worse movies out there than The Droving. It had potential to be a good watch, but missed the mark majorly with story and character development. Background sound made it difficult at times to hear dialogue and ending was a total letdown; making it a film that can be bypassed for most other movie options.", "helpful": ["26", "41"]},

This movie was suppose to stand out from the rest of the Netflix standards.Unfortunately..The writing was horrible. Love is messy but that doesn't mean the writing should be messy too! It seemed like the writer wanted to make a messy love story but forgot to actually focus on the STORY and rather just used quotes that left us with nothing. The characters had no depth and I felt like the writer was trying too hard to make them sound philosophical rather than just being a normal teenager trying to actually find love and not be in a 70 years old mind.\nNeeded another 1h and 40min to cover up all the many and messy parts of the movie.What triggeres me the most is that through out the whole movie the main core is \"WHAT IS LOVE\" where the movie follows how love is messy but actully never focuses on the long journey of it. All of a sudden the movie is rushed to an ending where all of the 3 protagonists finds the \"key\" to love and then knows everything about love after a KISS and some cliche quotes. COMEON. SHOW US THE LIVELIHOOD OF LOVE. Not the vague idea written in books with random quotes about the universe and stars.Of course the soundtrack has to be good just to occopy the teenagers mind to think that the movie is so great even though it's not. 4 stars for acting, soundtrack, editing etc..", "helpful": ["16", "26"]},

Not as many people know about Carne because it's a 35 minute short film, not a feature length film - BUT, his debut feature film I STAND ALONE is actually a direct continuation of what occurs in CARNE. Though I have known about I STAND ALONE since about 2003, I didn't hear about CARNE until this year. I actually think CARNE is superior to I STAND ALONE - because of the short runtime it's paced very quickly and features more of Gaspar's stylish cutting and editing. It is thoroughly entertaining, while I STAND ALONE is more a slow-burning, icky-feeling build to a wretched climax that will make pretty much everyone feel like they need to take a shower afterwards.Any way, this movie is very good. Probably one of the best short films I have ever seen. The singular style is turned up to 10. The performances are on point. And the dialogue, subject matter, and some of the visuals are immensely jarring. Though I STAND ALONE is not a movie I would ever recommend to anyone (because of the sickening subject matter), I suggest that for those who are interested, do not watch I STAND ALONE without seeing CARNE first. They should be watched in sequence, just as one should watch something like KILL BILL Vol. 1 and 2.Now that I've seen all of Gaspar Noe's films... I would rank them in this order...ENTER THE VOID > IRREVERSIBLE > CLIMAX > CARNE > LOVE > I STAND ALONE", "helpful": ["4", "4"]},

Having not been a big fan of the pilot the second episode of Season 1 was better and by the third I wanted to watch more and more with one of the best parts being when you rewatch old episodes it feels like your watching them for the first time again.The characters all fit together in their own way without anyone overplaying their part, they're also hilariously funny & practically all of them are extremely likeable none more so IMO than Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) also additionally I could possibly say that Amy Santiago & Jake Peralta are quite argubaly the best couple to come out of a TV show potentially ever.

Flat, humorless, dialogue aimed probably at the middle school level.\n4. Really bad science to fill people's brains. Besides the faster than light for a biological being (forget the energy demands) was the really dumb ring portal to the opposite side of the Universe.

She is 'courted ' by her friend Sonja (Tereza Srbova) and her brother Leo (Tom Hughes), supporters of the Soviet party, and is convinced to share the information about the making of the bomb with Stalin's Russia - partly because Joan hypothetically believes all powerful countries should have access to the A bomb in order to maintain equality and prevent abuse of the bomb in the manner the US used in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mixed with love affairs and fear Joan transfers the secret information to Soviet Russia, and her secrecy lasts until 1999 when MI5 agents arrest her. The film opens with contemporary time and then flashes back and forth to the 30s and 40s in a manner that makes the story credible.An excellent cast, especially Dench and Cookson, brings this story to life and the impact, whether you agree with the premise or not, makes the film absorbing.

The Sonic movie is definitely better than the Mario movie, although that was years ago. And it's better than the Mario TV show too.Jim Carrey is fantastic is Dr. Robotnik, and I expect him to be even better in the sequel, Sonic is actually likable as a cartoon character, and the rest of the human cast do a fine job supporting him, similar to any Garfield movie.

Even now, amc movie theaters is boycotting Universal Pictures and refusing to carry any of their films as universal enjoyed great success with this strategy and doesn't have to share the hundred million dollars they made on trolls World Tour with anybody.But back to the movie itself. The movie is a delightful children's film about different types of music, and how they can all work together in the end, from rock to pop to classical to funk to rock to... that's about it. but all the different styles of music, a little bit of reggae a little bit of Kpop, some smooth jazz (normal jazz seems to be ignored entirely,\nI guess funk is part of jazz). Anyway all of these different types of music come together in a beautiful story that I think will teach kids about the importance of listening to different types of music.

Lisa Kudrow.)That's about it for the review of the movie. I enjoyed the part where the women kept smoking joints and got in trouble for smoking joints at their friend's house. It was also great to see the dislike thrown upon these single working women from their married pregnant friends. And then the way that dislike quickly morphed into jealousy, later on, when the girls were going through trouble. It's a decent movie, the plot could have been better. It could have made more sense and been more straightforward but it's the slam together gobbly goo that they came up with. at least they didn't force any unnecessary romance on the characters, instead, mainly focusing on the business relationship, and the friendship.

First, it was EXTREMELY hard for me to watch. Now, admittedly, I have a hard time witnessing the depths of stupidity humanity has sprinkled within in. Always have, always will. This runs from flat earthers to religion and beyond. So this self failing negativly impacted my experience watching this. My gut reaction was to rate it much lower, but I know that wouldn't be fair for anyone reading this and thinking about watching it.Second, as for the documentary itself, it was well done in one sense, but misleading in another. Most people going into it will think it's at least in part going to have some decent arguments from the flat earthers to justify their belief. However, the best \"proof\" that was given was \"I can see that building there. If the Earth was round, I shouldn't be able to see it\". Face palm. Instead, 90% of it was aimed at the personalities and mental mindsets of people who consider themselves flat earthers, and fortunately, it doesn't paint them in a very flattering light. The editing was well done, the people included in the documentary were ...... interesting, and the creators did their best to not go out of their way to make the believers look like fools.....that's something they did all on their own, so in a way, it was nice to see the producers and director not pile it on.Bottom line, if you have spare time to kill and witnessing how ridiculous some of your neighbors can be doesn't bother you, it's entertaining enough.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

As someone who doesn't usually watch these types of movies I absolutely loved it and for such a film to get such a stellar cast with names like Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams & Tina Fey. I was pleasantly surprised at how much on screen chemistry there was and it all seemed to just fall into place.Lohan's character Cady is incredibly likeable from the start. A girl who has moved to a new school learning about cliques and the social hierachy. Rachel McAdams does a stunning job playing leader of the 'Plastics' Regina George where she's just catty enough to be seen as sort of an antagonist but not too much that it ruins the aesthetic of the film & a mention must be given to Amanda Seyfried for the brilliantly talented acting of the character Karen (your typical pretty but also pretty thick girl) all this with Fey's writing and good humoured portrayal of teacher Ms. Norbury and it's easy to see why this movie has helped launch careers of these actors and actresses (specifically Lohan)Having said that I would like to have seen the original characters stay or go back for a second movie without the need to potentially almost rush an ending like they did with Cady, Karen, Regina & Gretchen. It's like if they were to keep that ending but for the end of a second movie and have new events leading up to that.Overall though, a thoroughly enjoyable movie that made me laugh and had me rooting for Cady from almost the very beginning.

That is, saving somebody's memories does not \"save his consciousness\". Even if it somehow did, just running that consciousness on a computer would not make it actually \"run\". If that doesn't work, then the whole idea of making a meaningful connection, much less a relationship, with such consciousness is impossible.But, once you get past that, there are many interesting stuff. Almost every episode has a few good jokes, mostly coming out of this bizarre setting. The casting is very good. These are not great actors, but are very well selected for the roles that they play. Even beside jokes, there are interesting things to pounder on.The casting does work wonders here. Andy Allo is the perfect \"girl to take home to your mother\" and Allegra Edwards is perfect as \"interim girlfriend\". The protagonist is also great as a realistically handsome young man with a good heart, but no hero.By far the most interesting role and performance is from Allegra Edwards. Starting as a typical spoiled rich girl, we find that there's much more to her than that (which mostly comes from her very bad family). She's hot, but not as hot as she thinks she is, yet, for her, that actually works well (\"act hot for people to think you're hot\" - does not work for everybody, but it works great for Allegra and her character).The biggest problem is that towards the end of season 1, it starts to fall apart. The last episode is by far the worst. We're down to essentially no jokes, starting to take ourselves a little too seriously. At the end, the twist is pretty bad, undoing a lot of good done before. Mind you, you probably won't see it coming, but, to be surprising is not the whole point of a twist. Now, this is all a sort of a video-game, so, they may reboot that in season 2 (if there is one), but, the damage is done and I'm afraid it is beyond repair.", "helpful": ["9", "16"]},

Furthermore, he and Tom (Marsden) never try to hide from the villain and the government.\n~Some logical issues. For instance, Sonic spends most of the time in a car but his main power is speed.

David Staebler is a guarded, sometimes tongue tied introvert. He tries to communicate but he doesn't do a good job of it and his lack of personal experience with people ends up being fatal. David Staebler comes across as a person with high functioning autism would and the movie opens with him being removed from his comfort zone by his extroverted older brother Jason with another promise of something bigger than it really turns out to be.Ellen Burstyn ane Julia Anne Robinson play a stepmother stepdaughter pair who both date Jason. Scatman Crothere plays Lewis and he shares the best scene in the movie with Nicholson toward the end in one of Lewis' bars. In the scene, Lewis sees David, who is the artist of the two brothers as someone who would be great as a businessman and Jason with his visions and dreams of something bigger as an artist instead of a businessman. That scene alone might be way Crothers considers this role to be the best he ever played.Rafelson movies from the early 70s are heavy in drama like Five Easy Pieces. There is nothing wild about Nicholson as Staebler like Nicholson as Dupea in that film. He plays someone who is the perfect counterpart to Bruce Dern's Jason Staebler.Ellen Burstyn's performance is also a standout. The scenes are long like plays and at times you can see her character Sally disintegrate over the course of the scene. Jessica, Sally's stepdaughter playa the woman both brothers seem to want but neither really get. For Jason, he has Sally too and it gets too crowded for them and Jason keeps telling David that Jessica is interested in him though she never displays it. Her character is more seen instead of heard but she has a pivotal scene with David toward the climax of the film. Seeing this will make you feel its a tragedy that Julia Anne Robinson didnt live long after tue film's release.\n.\nLaszlo Kovacs really outdid himself with the quality of the cinematography. The darkened colors in the closed theater for Jessica's awkward performance for a fictional Miss America award stands out as do the shots of the Atlantic City boardwalk and David's lonely overnight journey home from Philadelphia to his grandfather's house during the opening titles. These images are so well done that they stay with you without really knowing it. No doubt one of my favorite films of the era.

But this is more a character study of two people who have significant, though different, issues in being able to relate to people so they've singled one another out, drawn by the recognition they're a beacon for one another to cling to during growth and maturation. The initial damage, we assume, is they've agreed to keep their relationship a secret. What we don't realize is the significance of their issues which are revealed much later. Initially, it seems like there are \"personality issues\" which set them apart, quirks that can endear or annoy. But as time wears on, more and more is stripped away, and while we think we know the answer to the turbulent relationship they have, we later learn there's significant pathology behind it.What keeps this from being just \"the best after-school special\" ever made, is the commitment of the performers, their talent, and the talent of the production team who give us one of the more memorable experiences yet in an extended series. We're as drawn to these characters as they are with one another, and the frustrating repetitiveness of their coming together then breaking apart, each time, has a valid crucial motive that leads to a conclusion that...well, is the best one to be reached. In different hands, I would imagine the courage of the screenplay would have been reduced to something much more familiar and predictable. But both the attraction and the suffering are portrayed with such candid and seemingly spontaneous commitment, we don't reject their repeated injury of one another.And finally, it all makes perfect sense. We recognize ourselves and what we learned growing up either more easily or with greater difficulty because the lessons learned are honest.At first this just seems like the usual \"anti-bullying\" film, but as it moves along, something darker is at work. And the mystery that keeps us watching is the hope we'll find out what that is. The screenplay doesn't disappoint us, and it becomes an object lesson in relationships.All of the cast is marvelous. They are each from major to minor role so perfect that clearly the producers are the ones who worked hard to bring this together. But the two leads, occupying 80% of the screen time hit every mark, every dramatic beat with uncanny precision for such young actors.While Ms. Edgar-Jones has the showier role, Mr. Mescal is just mesmerizing how he illustrates the character's mute inability to express or even know himself. Watching him evolve as a character is thrilling. But paired with Ms. Edgar-Jones, their scenes are electrifying.When haunted by loneliness, the peril of every choice that could shatter or destroy these very fragile lives, I don't ever remember seeing a better portrayal what self-isolation does. The fact this is an extended format, that holds us enthrall, is even the more amazing. It's a rare accomplishment.", "helpful": ["12", "25"]},

Seems the monster cows (more like lobsters) are running out of forage on other planets, so here they come. Somehow the menace seems oddly ironical if you think about how Native Americans were cleared for our own cattle grazing herds. In that sense, the flick can be taken as a thought-provoking allegory on the America's so-called taming of the West. However that may be, the z-budget flick has its compensations. The best part is Thor chasing down Derek amidst LA residential areas. It's a good look at period styles. Then too, what 50's sci-fi would be complete without a look at Bronson Cave where monsters always hung out. Despite other opinion, I thought the acting was fairly accomplished for a cast of unknowns. At the same time, it looks like none of these leads went on to a professional career. The cheesy part shows up, as usual, with the monsters; here, black shadows of a lobster are cast on the screen that's about as scary as my shadow. Good thing they're kept to a minimum. And catch the unnamed book that incites Derek's rebellion against the other aliens on their earth mission. I'm guessing it's supposed to be the Bible though that remains anonymous.

He came to save us from our sins.The character development is wonderful too. It's satisfying to see the characters grow as they're confronted with themselves, and the hopelessness of their situations. You understand all the more their desperation, their loneliness, their doubts. And Jesus doesn't gloss over things or make everything easy. He doesn't call people to safety, but to follow Him.\nThere's also throwbacks to people in the Old Testament, so you can see how the stories of the Old Testament correspond to the New Testament.\nThe cinematography is beautiful as well as the song tracks.\nLast, the Jesus character in this series is so refreshing.

The image recalls the iconic poster of Hitchcodk's Vertigo with Jimmy Stuart and the San Juan Batista. But the comparison must end there because \"Deadly Shores\" turned out to be deadly dull.The protagonist Anna, the screamer in the poster, has recently been released from a mental institution where she was under the care of Dr. Shaw. The doctor is troubled that Anna has made the decision to marry a mystery writer who resides in an old lighthouse where his first wife died under suspicious circumstances. The good doctor has good reason to be concerned.The drama unfolds with Anna moving into the lighthouse as Mrs. Richard Palmer. But it turns out the mystery writer is deep in debt and is planning to drive Anna insane, have her institutionalized, and walk away with her estate. Richard is aided by his lover Beth, who likely collaborated with Richard on the death of the first Mrs. Richard Palmer.Two other characters are noteworthy. There is the eccentric Mrs. Argyle, the cook, who treats Anna with disdain. There is also Carrie, the bartender at the Sail Croft watering hole, who is sympathetic towards Annie's plight. There are also some filler scenes with the local pastor and his wife that do not add anything to narrativeWhile slow-paced, the film started to pick up some momentum, prior to imploding at the end. It was not made clear why Richard suddenly changed his mind and attempted to kill Anna instead of driving her mad. Then, the complete transformation of Anna into a fiend who goes on a rampage was not made credible. Perhaps she was a nut case who killed her parents in a fire. But the unexpected transformation from the passive Anna to the avenging fury seemed implausible.\"Deadly Shores\" was disappointing both as a thriller and as a character study. Anna's plight was touching until she became the demon that sent her right back to the nut house. At least she was spared the fate of the first Mrs. Richard Palmer.", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

    {"review_id": "rw5704718", "reviewer": "totalovrdose", "movie": "The Hatred (2017)", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "Surprisingly Enjoyable Narrative-Light Horror", "review_date": "4 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "The Hatred feels like a movie that has been based upon the first draft of a script. A decent first draft at that, but still, there are so many plot holes, the movie begins to resemble an empty graveyard.I receive two feelings from the film's lengthy introduction, set during the late 1960s. The first, is contradictory; despite being long, there is so much we do not understand. You would imagine a prologue that runs for approximately 20% of the movie would be able to give greater explanations. Second, it should have been broken apart and spread non-chronologically throughout the film, to withhold information and increase suspense. Samuel Sears (Andrew Divoff) is a Nazi, who migrated to an American community to escape the war. The townspeople it seems accept him to a degree, though his paranoid reaction to the outside world makes for intolerable stress on his daughter Alice (Darby Walker), who he demands remain at home at all times, and creates further tension with his open-minded wife Miriam (Nina Siemaszko). When he receives a gift from Germany, celebrating his great work with Hitler, the cursed amulet he receives begins to negatively affect the household even more.The film then forwards itself to the present day, where Regan (Sarah Davenport), the film's protagonist, is preparing to give up her life in the city for a more relaxing time in the country. She has agreed to stay the night with Irene (Shae Smolik), a girl she used to babysit, who has moved with her family into the house from the film's prologue. Regan's friends, Layan (Gabrielle Bourne), Samantha (Bayley Corman) and Betaine (Alisha Wainwright), have come with her to say goodbye over what is expected to be a fun-filled girl's night. The friendships do appear genuine, with great banter between the characters, and though characterisation is in short supply, every girl has a unique personality trait that compliments the others. That said, some of the lines in the script land about as well as a sky diver without a parachute. Some of the politeness between the characters, as an example, seems overly buoyant.As to be expected, with an item of evil still lurking somewhere in the home, things don't go quite according to plan. On the one hand, predictability does ensue. There are jump-scares-a-plenty, accompanied by typical creepy music. Some of these in-your-face moments are bland, though others are particularly effective. What the film expertly nails however, is the tone and atmosphere, creating an environment brimming with malevolent dread. This is, without a doubt, one of the best qualities of the film.As stated earlier, The Hatred occasionally feels like an early draft, and though the horror is what makes the movie so appealing, this is also one of the film's greatest weaknesses. We are offered virtually no information on the amulet cursing the estate, and anything we are given is mere conjecture, and doesn't connect with what happens on screen. At one point, Regan's grandmother (Nancy Linehan Charles), seems to have a narrative connection to the horror, before abruptly vanishing from the film completely. Moreover, spectres who were originally homicidal suddenly change their modus operandi in a manner that doesn't seem earned, while others are able to conceivably tie people up. It's an interesting gimmick, but considering all we really have to go on here is our prior experiences with the genre, it doesn't entirely make sense - nor fit the premise.Another issue is Regan herself. She is revealed as brave, rational, headstrong and confident, and though regaling us with a story of how her friends made her college years so much better, she is concerned only with the preservation of herself and Irene. There is one specific moment where she sees someone in danger and just leaves them for dead, without any demonstration of emotion. This makes her seem strangely sociopathic, and thus difficult to sympathise with, despite the strong empathetic and nurturing characteristics she is revealed to have.For every strength the film has, there is an equal weakness. That said, The Hatred can be easily viewed, and is rewatchable, as long as you promptly shut your brain off beforehand. This is a film designed to accompany popcorn; definitely not a thinking-person's film.", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

I had no idea what to expect going into it...other than it being a home invasion movie, but with a babysitter and some kids.I did not see that twist coming. I had an idea something was up with Lucas, but just thought he was an awkward, creepy kid.Plot is pretty simple. Parents going to a Christmas party. Babysitter comes over. Teenage boy plans to woo her since he's into her. The night starts out a little weird since he keeps making cringeworthy passes at her, even going so far as to put his hand on her thigh then go in for a kiss. Then things start getting weird as it seems like someone's lurking outside. Eventually someone enters and there's a game of cat and mouse with the girl, Ashley, and Lucas hiding from the burglar. When hiding in a closet, Ashley notices that the burglar is wearing Lucas' snow hat/mask and calls him out. It ends up being Lucas' friend Garrett and it's revealed they wanted to play a prank on her....at least that's what Garrett thought. After Ashley berates Lucas, he slaps her causing her to tumble down the stairs. Next thing you know, she's tied up and it's revealed that Lucas is crazy and had more in store than we all thought.Things get even more messed up from there. A current boyfriend comes over and after some taunting is killed by the infamous Home Alone paint can thing. Gross. Then an ex bf comes over under the impression that she wants him yo apologize. But he is killed by Lucas who hangs him using a noose connected to a lawn mower. After Lucas realizes that Garrett is helping Ashley (since Garrett had no idea things were gonna go this far), he shoots Garrett and kills him. He then seemingly kills Ashley.Lucas proceeds to set up everything to look like a murder suicide with the ex bf, and puts himself to bed taking his nightly sedative so when the parents come home, he acts as if he slept thru it all. While the police investigate it is revealed Ashley survived and is being taken to the hospital. In a mid-credit scene, Lucas says to his mom that they should visit her in the hospital.Excellent suspense, pretty decent acting, gross out violence and a great twist.

I disagree, we saw that in the movie, this was about that order from the point of view of two of the main characters of the series.

Soon after arriving in Paris, he meets a group of Bohemians that talk him into writing a musical that would be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. Later on, Christian had a meeting setup with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the courtesan of the night club. Christian meets with Satine and he falls head over heels in love with her, as she does him, but there was one small problem. Satine was told by Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the club's owner, that she was meeting with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). The Duke was interested in investing in the club and to make Satine a real actress for a small price, to have Satine in his possession forever. Satine was thrilled to have fallen in love with the Duke, until she realized it was not him, instead she had fallen for a penniless writer.\nLove is the central and most powerful theme of Moulin Rouge. Not only is it shown between two people, but it is also shown with Satine and the other dancers at the Moulin Rouge. They are all in love with the thought of being real stars one day that they will do anything to get there, including work in a night club. The director of the movie does a wonderful job making love the central theme with lighting and angles. The lighting dims around the background activity and extra lighting goes onto the characters during intense romantic scenes. Also, the director films at many different angels in the movie. He switches between first person angles and third person angles. He does this to allow you to not only feel the main characters emotions, but you also get to feel the background characters emotions. The movie, Moulin Rouge, will take you on a crazy journey of love and grief, and will have your eyes glued to the television the entirety of the film.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

The easy and predictable romance could be the worst, i'll give it two more episodes to get a little better, but for now definitely not my kind.\nIt's a shame because the subject of afterlife could have been really effective but the approach deleted every narrative tension leaving only a sense of boredom.Edit End of the 1st Season; 5/10\nThe serie gets better after the first episode, the plot starts to make some sense, characters become slightly 3dimensional and some good themes come out.\nBut truth is that this serie is a gargantuan \"could have been\" for me, the mix between drama and comedy it's annoying, even in their better form the characters (Nathan overall) and the plot are really too flat.\nThe point is that this serie has a good idea on the background, but it's made in a completely wrong way, doesn't really treat any of the themes that pinpoints using deus ex-machina and comedy to avoid a real form of thinking.\nThe world is depicted like a giant playground and its dynamics are childish as hell, the usual bad-comedy approach, but then it comes the drama, leterally out of nowhere and out of any context. It would have been bad even if the drama led to some kind of reflection, but there's not even the shadow of any real thougt, this is a playground and nothing has any real consequence, nothing said really means anything.I really don't understand people who gives 10/10, talks of \"deep philosophy\" (???) et cetera.

Nine months later, we see Mandy adjusting to normal high school life and having met new friends (minus Emmett, the guy who dared the jock to jump off of the roof). She's been invited to one of her friends parents properties to have a party, which she says yes to.It quickly becomes apparent that all of the teenage boys have made a pledge to try and have sex with Mandy (even if they have girlfriends). They all start playing drinking games and \"truth or dare\", and not before long they start getting picked off one by one by an unknown assailant. The killer is revealed pretty quickly, and the rest of the film is Mandy and her remaining friends trying to survive.All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is not a great movie. The problem I had was that I was contanstly questioning what was so special about Mandy Lane? Yes, she/Amber Heard is gorgeous ... but enough for every single male character to obsess over the way they did? Also, the killers reveal was WAY too early for me and kind of ruined any suspense or tension that could've been milked out of this movie. There was twist at the end which I sort of suspected half way through, so that wasn't even as fun as it should have been. Plus it was not well explained at the end.All in all, this is a mediocre horror film from 2006 with a very low budget. The budget isn't even to blame for the movie's problems. It has characters we don't care about, a plot that doesn't make any sense, and an ending twist at the end that isn't explained. I'd skip this one.4/10", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

He created WKRP in Cincinnati, Frank's Place and The Famous Teddy Z, plus he directed The First Wives Club, Burglar, Blast from the Past and Guarding Tess.He was the director of the first Police Academy, a film that every movie this week is really all about.Producer Paul Maslansky got the idea for the film while making The Right Stuff, as he watched a gang of mismatched police cadets getting screamed at by a sergeant. He claims that the group was \"an unbelievable bunch-including a lady who must have weighed over 200 pounds and a flabby man of well over 50. I asked the sergeant about them, and he explained that the mayor had ordered the department to accept a broad spectrum for the academy. \"We have to take them in and the only thing we can do is wash them out.\"\"Boom. Police Academy.The mayor wants to improve the police force, so he asks that the academy accept willing recruits, regardless of gender, body weight, skin color or age.One of those unwilling recruits is Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), the everyman who we follow throughout the first of these movies and their sequels. He keeps getting in trouble for standing up to authority and his father's friend Chief Hurst - out of respect for a fellow cop - demands that Mahoney either go to police academy or prison. Mahoney agrees if he can bring along a noisemaking man he just met, Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow).Guttenberg was made for this, as just like his character, his father was a cop.Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey, an enemy cop in nearly every one of these films) wants to wash the candidates out. Mahoney wants to quit. And when he's not daydreaming, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) wants his cadets to do well.As I always say, hijinks ensue. Mahoney sends the two mean cadets to a gay bar called The Blue Oyster that I promise you, most Japanese people still use as a cultural touchstone for what gay bars look like. Hightower (Bubba Jones) is protective of the quiet Hooks (Marion Ramsey). Tackleberry (David Graf) loves guns. Leslie Barbara is chubby. George Martin is a ladies man. Douglas Fackler (Bruche Mahler) is accident-prone.Pretty much every character gets a one-note that they will use for the rest of the film if not the rest of the series. But hey - it's honestly really funny. Maybe it's because I was twelve when I first saw it. Or it could be that I'm still twelve inside.For the first film, Leslie Easterbrook's Sgt. Debbie Callahan isn't on the side of the good guys, but she will be soon. And Georgina Spelvin from The Devil In Ms. Jones has a memorable cameo.The Police Academy movies often feature people before they become famous and then are sore spots on their resumes. For this movie, that person would be Kim Cattrall, who plays Mahoney's love interest. She will not be the last big star to wander into these films, often in one of their first starring roles.I also love that the \"shoe polish on the megaphone\" came from a prank played on British director Michael Winner (Death Wish, The Sentinel) on the set of one of his movies.President Bill Clinton told Guttenberg that this was one of his favorite movies, and that watching the films helped him through a difficult time. We can only assume that this was during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. I wonder how hard he laughed at the oral sex joke.", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

Murphy, plays Jed Sayer an Army lieutenant trying to keep the peace between the soldiers and the Indians. The problem is a treacherous Brig General named Storey ( Ray Collins), who knows the Civil War is coming and is for the Confederacy, and wants to stir up trouble. Besides that his Commanding Officer Captain Lee Whitlock ( Robert Sterling). Is also for the Confederacy. Yo be honest, Whitlock is a decent man, but is also weak and is easily manipulated by Storey. Jed also has a love interest, Lee's sister Marcy ( Joan Evans), who goes from a person who despises the Indians and will not eat with them (I do not call her a bigot, because she was very naive), to someone more then just a love interest. Spoilers ahead: Jed, Lee and Marcy are part of a squad ordered to leave the fort with few troops knowing the Indians will attack. However, while they are camped out, Jed finds a letter of Whitlock's explaining the plan to help the South, which will result in people dying, while the Confederates led by Whitlock head south ( hence the Title 'Column South'). Jed and the troops loyal to the Union head back to the Fort, but are ambushed by the Indians. Fortunately for Jed and the troops, Marcy explains she is embarrassed by Lee's conduct and is a Southerner with honor also, and the South would be embarrassed to win this way. Whitlock realizes she's is right, and goes back and helps defeat the Indians ( the Indians attacked because they were framed by Storey for a theft of guns and were forced off their land). Storey who was earlier captured by the Indians had to confess his crime, and the Indians went home. Then the Civil War started, and Whitlock and the other Confederates went to join the South, while Marcy stayed with Jed, The last thing Whitlock said is \"Take good care of her.\" I like the character growth in Marcy going from someone who looked down on the Indians, to the person who by saying what she thought, saved lives, and helped her brother regain his sense of duty and honor. Again it is a very good Murphy Western. I give it 8/10 stars.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

The vast majority of the world's countries-including all the great powers-eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, genocides (including the Holocaust), strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with China by 1937, though neither side had declared war on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the Fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire. War in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This Eastern Front trapped the Axis, most crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the United States as well as European colonies in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by some in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943-which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in the Pacific-cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, the Japanese suffered major reversals in mainland Asia, in Central China, South China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August, respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and against the Japanese.World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers-China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States-became the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.This movie is epic", "helpful": ["1", "2"]},

While raising two other children of their own, and fighting the many battles of two, very much Caucasian taking in an African American. On a side note who is freakishly tall to say the least. Most would be quick to judge and assume that he is stealing from them, or using them. But \"Big Mike\" was just grateful to have a home and a place to lay his head at night. He didn't know how to react or what to expect because he had been homeless for so long. His mother was a drug addict and was not able to provide for him. When Leigh Ann (Sandra Bullock) observes this she acts fast on taking him home, and what was thought to just be a few nights turned into Leigh Ann and Sean (Tim McGraw) adopting him and eventually sending him off to college. This changed both his life and their own and their children as well. You can easily see that this film contains a drama theme. While it could also be a \"sport\" themed movie, due to Michael becoming a well renown football star, I really think that drama is the most important piece here.Sandra and Tim do an excellent job, parenting together, bringing this man into their lives, despite the judgements they Receive from people in the community. As well as the judgements that SJ and Collins are thrown into for being white and being around Michael is is not white. Those are just some prime examples of why this has a theme of drama. Michael had been in and out of schools, and Leigh Ann wanted him enrolled in the private Christian school where the other kids are going, while he really struggled with school due to being in and out of the school system, his athletic ability is what got him into this private school.The acting by all characters is nothing short of excellent, these specific actors work really well together and make this film seem more realistic as it is based on a true story. I would say that motif is a common and appropriate technique, due to the repetitive judgments that the family is getting for taking Michael in, the other important technique is lighting, especially in the scenes where Michael is in the field playing football. All of this easily ties together making this a drama film, also showing the love that this family creates for Michael to make him feel at home, and feel accepted into their family.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

There's Laurence Harvey, Richard Basehart, John Ireland and Stanley Baker, for men in younique indifferent stations in life, joined together for a crime that the audience knows will take them down. Their women are Gloria grahame, Joan Collins, Renee Ray and Margaret Leighton, and of the four women, only Collins and Ray are decent while the other two are either self-centered or deadly. Collins is faced with an aging, suicidal mother (Freda Jackson) who keeps spoiling her attempts to be with the man she loves, while Grahame is a self centered film star stepping out on her man. When he captures her, it's a hysterical seeing that literally will leave her in cold water.For the first hour of this film, we are led to believe through flashbacks that's something dangerous is about to happen, but other than the opening segment of the four men gathered together and showing their weapons are we aware that they are up to no good. These revelations are important to move the story along, and the film is not boring at all in telling these pre crime happenings. The last half-hour is where the film really hits a top-notch speed, and it is a race to the finish line for all of them as they are able to get the crime done but their own greed is destined to do them in. one ironic moment has a final grin of one of the men as he takes care of another one, and it is quite ironic.The cleverness of the script makes this very intriguing, and the fast pacing even in the non-criminal flashback scenes will keep you engrossed.

In other words...\"we're untouchable\"/Dark Waters is an excellent drama based on the real legal fight to expose Dupont's deadly Teflon product itself as well as it's myriad disease inducing by-products. In the film you feel the sense of futility in taking on the behemoth corporation whose deep-pockets and callous maneuvering often seemed impenetrable. Mark Ruffalo is perfect as the reluctant, yet dogged, attorney who suffered through over a decade and myriad downturns to expose Dupont's criminal negligence. You feel a bit of the turmoil and pain just watching the man as he suffers his own declining health in the bargain. This is a screenplay sans Hollywood posturing and bombast. It feels honest as it shows the constant struggle to a finish line with the slimmest of chances for victory. The supporting cast is no slouch either. Tim Robbins as Ruffalo's boss is excellent. It should also be noted the producers have included some of the real people who suffered under the umbrella Dupont Corporation cast.In closing though there was a reckoning of sorts one might call an ultimate victory we're reminded Dupont made for years over a billion dollars profit from just Teflon. Teflon, a product I'd say almost 100% of us let into our homes using to our detriment unknowingly. The fact that most of us have elements of this product in our blood feels like a crime of unprecedented proportions. I can truly say this film made me disgusted with hate for Dupont.

    {"review_id": "rw5704900", "reviewer": "caleblimsw", "movie": "Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)", "rating": "3", "review_summary": "Rian Johnson sets his targets far too high", "review_date": "4 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Firstly, let's address something. Why so many critics and certain fans consider this movie to be good is due to 2 reasons.1. The movie goes out of it's way to subvert every possible expectation\n2. The movie is filled with themes and ideas about ambiguity and reality which are interesting and powerful.Here's my reply to those critics.1. There's a proper way to subvert expectations. Luke throwing his lightsaber away and refusing to come out of exile? Good subverting of expectations. Rey's parents are nobodies? Good subverting of expectations. Snoke dies anticlimactically? Bad subverting of expectations. Luke and Kylo's backstory? Bad subverting of expectations. It doesn't matter how \"thematically relevant\" the subverting of expectations is, it has to be justified. Even moments like the reveal of Rey's parentage, which is a good subverting of expectations, is bogged down and has no impact because of her portrayal as the greatest Force-user since Luke.When you pull a twist, it has to make sense, there has to be some kind of set-up which rewards a narrative twist. Johnson does none of this. He pulls twist after twist on our characters, trying to explore the complexity of them, only to realise that he can't form a proper explanation or even a single moment of set-up to justify his twists.If a movie's twists are just for the sake of surprising the audience, it's a bad movie. We can take twists. Vader was Luke's father. What a twist! Leia was Luke's sister all along. Not so good, but still believable. Han Solo changes from his money-driven scoundrel to come back and help save Luke at the end of the original film. That was a justified twist, because we've spent time with Han getting to know that he has morals, even with his greed. Johnson justifies nothing, and simply hopes that our shock will suspend our disbelief enough for his next \"twist\".\n2. Yes, I will agree that Johnson is aiming for themes that aren't just powerful, but universal: anyone can be a hero, heroes can lose hope, sacrifice, freedom should be universal, the world isn't always black and white. But that's just it. All Johnson has is wonderful themes, which he brings up occasionally, explores shallowly, then discards and keeps moving. It's as though he thinks that by simply bringing up these themes he has made the movie greater.No. No to all the critics who smugly point at these themes and claim that since it uses more interesting themes than the other SW films, then it must be better. Because Rian Johnson never explores these themes in a way that truly engages the audience. Luke has descended from his heroism and fallen from grace. Excellent! So much potential has opened up! And then he and Rey interact in no manner that sparks any development in his character. Yoda's ghost has to come in and try to push Luke's arc forwards, by urging him to let go of the past. Let's recall, why is this not effective? Because of context. Because we've seen Luke devastated already, when he lost his hand and had to deal with the life-changing realisation that the monster who laid waste to countless star systems was, in fact, his father, that his beloved mentor Ben Kenobi had lied to him. So when they expect us to believe that Luke never went after Ben Solo, who simply retreated into exile without a whimper, you can see the disparity. Johnson doesn't give us a believable fall because in the story of Luke's fall, Luke is entirely passive.Give him something to do! Let Luke chase Ben Solo, and witness his nephew's fall to the dark side. Let him experience the death of his old friend Han Solo, have that drive Luke further away into himself, and give Rey more to do than chase Luke around begging. Make Luke's fall believable, and his redemption will be all the more powerful, and the theme will emerge more powerfully. Instead, what we get is a lacklustre imagining of the character, depending again (Johnson again does this) on your suspension of disbelief.I could go on and on about how the countless other themes and ideas that Johnson introduced fell short of their intended purposes, because they did. It's not good enough for a movie to have a good message or interesting themes. It has to tell a good story. More so in this movie. Rian Johnson doesn't seem to understand that we've already seen 4 movies starring Luke Skywalker. We know his character. Rian Johnson needed to continue that story of Luke Skywalker in a way that fit the character, and at the same time include these rich themes.\nThe Fundamental Problem With The Last Jedi's Deeper MessagesRian Johnson tries for too much, and in order to fit it all in, his plot and characterisation are sacrificed. If only he'd decided to focus on a few main themes (loss of hope, redemption, sacrifice, moral ambiguity), and not tried to shoehorn in literally every other theme he could think of, and took the time to explore those ideas fully, we'd get several fully fulfilled themes in a tighter, cohesive movie where the characters experience change that feels natural. Instead he spreads it out, and none of the themes are developed properly, character arcs are forced into motion for the sake of the theme, and Johnson generates plotholes so large we can't help but notice them.If we go back to Johnson's utter disregard for the other films, it's because he violates the internal logic of the universe which angers fans. A lightspeed charge? That tactic, if possible, would've been invented years ago, and whichever side had more lightspeed equipped, droid-piloted freighters would win, which is why hyperspace exists. Why do we find it so hard to accept rey's ancestry? Because of how powerful she is. Rey is on a Ben Solo level, and pretty damn close to Luke, too. Ben Solo and Luke are direct descendants of the Chosen One, the single most powerful Force-user to be born, who was leaps beyond even Yoda and Palpatine. Luke and Ben are only slightly below their father and grandfather respectively. So when you push Rey's power level that high so consistently, then she must've some powerful blood, right? Wrong. She's a nobody, and that's good, as long as (1) we see her work for her power and skill  we don't] or (2) It's made clear that although she is strong, she's not the strongest [\"I haven't seen such power since...\" Johnson has Luke say, implying her power is on a ridiculous level].It simply doesn't make sense, either, that a Sith Lord (or whatever Snoke is) would be unable to put up a fight. It's anticlimactic, and when Rey and Kylo Ren fight the guards in the throne room, you don't cheer for Rey because she hasn't earned it. Luke earned his victory over Vader in Return of the Jedi by losing badly to Vader in Empire Strikes Back, and then coming back with a rebuilt lightsaber. Rey has done nothing but win, win, win. Her torture in Force Awakens gave her the narrative power to beat Kylo Ren in a great fight in the snow. In the Last Jedi, we're supposed to simply accept that she's better now because she went down a hole and stared in a mirror, when Luke had to fight \"Vader\" in the caves of Dagobah, only to lose. Simply put, the internal logic just isn't there. Snoke's death wasn't earned, it was just another example of Rian Johnson thinking as long as he subverts expectations he's a smart writer. Rey's win over Kylo Ren wasn't earned either.\nThis Movie Is Still Occasionally EnjoyableHowever, I won't deny the great parts in this movie, when occasionally Rian Johnson hits the marks he wanted to hit. The cinematography and effects are astounding and wonderful to watch. The beginning is a brilliantly tense and action-packed battle, which later devolves into a tenseless, boring chase. Johnson really hits on what the Force means when Luke first teaches Rey how to feel the Force, then ruins it by having Rey slice a rock and pretend that it was impressive. Johnson shoots an excellently choreographed action sequence in the throne room, but as explained before, it only highlights his narrative failure to make this scene fit with the characters we know (Mary Sue mode is on full here). Johnson gives Luke a cool sendoff, but could've made Luke's power more substantial, given that he is the strongest Force-user in the galaxy. But that's a nitpick, and I acknowledge that. Rian Johnson's concept of the connection between Rey and Kylo Ren were by far the standout moments of the film, allowing Ridley and Driver to shine, and provide an interesting look into each other's lives. The theme of moral ambiguity explored between these two characters is the only one that is truly impactful. This resulted in what is basically the only narrative payoff, which was Kylo Ren offering his hand to Rey. Of course, Rey refuses, and has an again limp \"I am a Jedi, like my father before me\"-ish moment because of how badly her character was developed. Best of all, Johnson's shot of the Force-sensitive slave child towards the end. That was a wonderful scene, which doesn't forgive the pace-destroying, mind-numbingly stupid Rose and Finn subplot. There could've been far better ways to reach that conclusion than through a forced subplot.\nAll in all, Rian Johnson's thematically bold, subversion-obsessed movie shoots for the stars, but ends up hanging limply in orbit instead, while trying to reach those lofty heights he greatly compromised plot and character arcs, although superb visuals, subtle and sometimes excellent acting, and the occasional brilliant scene stop this movie from crashing all the way down.Normally I'd give this 4/10, but the reviews on this site seem so rigged, and critics so determined to mark all who disliked this film as \"trolls\" and \"haters\", that I'm subtracting a star.3/10 it is, Johnson. And for the record, I liked The Force Awakens and prefer Rise of Skywalker to Last Jedi. At least Abrams tried.", "helpful": ["12", "15"]},

With the help of the confinement I have watched a good number since then, including a few romcom or love stories which I liked. Believe it or not, this is the first time I saw either leads and it's only by reading other reviews here that I learnt they are both big stars despite their age difference. Hence my review is not influenced by their reputation nor am I in a position to compare their performance with their other roles. I am rating this show simply based on my enjoyment and my expectation from a love story.Many reviewers considered the plot too simplistic and boring. That's one of the main reasons I loved this show. I did not want a thriller or political intrique. I wanted to see two people falling in love and eventually falling out of love. I wanted to see their relationship grow as they talk to each other. I am not looking for plot twists unless they come from the couple themselves - fear, lack of trust, over possessiveness, pride, self-interest... so I was happy that a large part of the show is focused on the couple. Apart from the mandatory breakup, I am relieved there aren't many plot twists. Everyone knows there are always at least one or two evil or well-meaning characters who will get in the way and they are here but, as far as I am concerned, they don't distract from the core love story.Is the love story realistic? Of course not, in terms of a beautiful and tragic CEO's chance meeting in a foreign land with a handsome but much younger man who turns out to be a future entry-level employee in her company. But in the context of a love story and a modern day fairy tale, this is not a problem.In real life, for better or for worse, the office romance between a (female) CEO and a much younger (male) employee, if that actually were to happen, would obviously be problematic and considered socially unacceptable by most. In a fairy tale drama, that makes for a good story.As a guy I at first found Park Bo-gum's physical feature too feminine and his smile too cheesy and borderline creepy. However, after getting used to it, I admit his youthful, idealistic and always sunny outlook is exactly what his character is supposed to be in order for the CEO to fall in love with him. More than anything else in this drama, I find his forever optimistic and never-angry personality the most unrealistic element. Yet, because I view this as a fairy tale and the actor played this role so naturally, this does not distract from my enjoyment of this show at all.As mentioned, my enjoyment of this show comes from watching our couple's relationship evolve. Truth be told, their relationship is rather simple. He fell heads over heels for her (for her beauty?) and she for his optimistic and free spirit life view, romantic character and ultimately his ability to rescue her from her self-imposed habit of sacrificing her own desire and happiness for that of others. Literally, he is her knight in shining armor and, viewed from this angle, her attraction and love for him is totally believable in my book. The actress Song Hye-kyo is classy and her portrayal of a stoic figure with tragic history is touching.This is my first 10 rating for a kdrama. Not because it is perfect, but because the actors are fabulous and they brought to life this simple love story and feel-good drama which happened to be what I am looking for at this time, without too many tedious subplots and turn twists which are common in most Kdramas.", "helpful": ["8", "9"]},

    {"review_id": "rw5704943", "reviewer": "gbill-74877", "movie": "Gabriel Over the White House (1933)", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Fascinating and horrifying", "review_date": "4 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "A fascinating and horrifying window into America three years into the Great Depression, and right before FDR was inaugurated. As Thomas Doherty so brilliantly describes it in his book \"Pre-Code Hollywood,\" the desperation of the times led to interest in political strong-men, or a \"dictator craze,\" which manifested itself here and in a few other films. The film shows some shocking events - the President (Walter Huston) declaring martial law, suspending congress, and bypassing the court system to execute gangsters with the Statue of Liberty ironically in the background. On the other hand, it also shows him passionately speaking up for the unemployed, wanting to end the waste of food when millions were starving, and stopping the culture of \"business as usual\" in Washington. The frustration and anger the film reflects is palpable, and while the \"solution\" of a wise dictator is something I recoil from, what the film informs us about the period make it a must-see pre-Code film for me.Before being divinely inspired, we learn several things about the new President, starting with that he's well-connected with other politicians and a member of the good old boys club. He doesn't plan on keeping his campaign promises. He doesn't know world geography. He doesn't have time for interruptions, his mistress (Karen Morley) excepted. He wants questions from the press a day in advance, and control over what gets printed. He views the leader of a mass of men marching on Washington as a dangerous anarchist, and has no sympathy at all for them (the group no doubt representing the real life Bonus Army of 1932). He views unemployment and the rise in crime to be \"local problems,\" and believes that in time, America will simply weather the storm and rise again. In other words, he doesn't plan on doing much of anything, despite widespread suffering. This is how many saw Herbert Hoover and the state of affairs in Washington at the time, their confidence in the system sorely shaken.Later the president arranges for an army plane to fly down the latest copy of a detective magazine, and plays on the floor with his nephew while the radio carries a speech beseeching him:\"This is John Bronson speaking, not for himself, but for about a million men who are out of work, who cannot earn money to buy food because those responsible for providing work have failed in their obligations. We ask no more than that every citizen of the United States should be ensured to have the right to put food in mouths of our wives and children. Our underlying purpose is not revolutionary. We are not influenced by militant leaders. None of us are Reds. We merely want work, and we believe that these great United States of America, under proper leadership, can provide work for everybody. I have appealed to the president for an interview. But the president says that he will not deal with us because we are dangerous anarchists. We are not! We are citizens of America with full confidence in American democracy, if it is properly administered.\"When it first comes to pass that the president has changed his outlook, it seems like it's going to be an easy to understand and positive thing. He says that with \"Tons of food rotting....millions of people starving...what's to prevent us from putting this food into the mouths of the hungry?\" He goes directly into the army of the unemployed, strolling through them just as Huston the actor did in the prison yard in The Criminal Code (1931), and speaks from the heart, telling them he'll put them to work in an \"Army of Construction\" on public works. Soon he's telling the people that he will prevent the foreclosure of mortgages, a national banking law to protect their money, and direct financial aid to farmers. He questions all of the money that's being spent on the military. He also talks about repealing Prohibition and in the meantime, cracking down on crime. These all seem like great things (and most of which are still highly relevant), but along the way, because of the resistance to his ideas and the threat of impeachment, he's declared a state of emergency and become a dictator.What's extraordinary is that the film shows this to be a positive thing, and as Thomas Doherty wisely observes, the film signals a parallel in Abraham Lincoln's expansion of executive power during another existential crisis the country faced. He points out Huston's Lincoln-like pose while seated, the suspension of habeas corpus, the marchers singing The Battle Hymn of the Republic, and the president passing away once his work is done. To that I'd add the usage of the quill pen Lincoln used to sign the Emancipation Proclamation and the reference to the Gettysburg Address when Huston's character refers to his duty to bring the citizens of the country \"the last full measure of protection and help.\" The film isn't suggesting the suspension of democracy to be a permanent change, but even suggesting them at all is alarming, though reflective of desperation.Aside from, you know, the whole dictator thing, the film also has little bits of ugliness in mentioning the nation's top gangster is an immigrant who \"at least rid the country of a number of your own kind\" but now should \"return to your own country.\" It also signals an \"America first\" mentality in its collection of debts from other countries, including a plea for world peace but only after an intimidating show of its military might. The film is thus all over the place politically, with elements of fascism mixed in with anticipating the progressive liberalism of FDR, which was repelling and yet fascinating.The film is prescient in its depiction of the president communicating to the people over mass media (radio in these days), and in warning of the enormous power of bombing and \"inconceivably devastating explosives\" in the next world war. It also speaks to fundamental issues still plaguing America - unequal wealth distribution, political lethargy, and priorities not geared towards helping its citizens - making it not only a window into its past, but in what ideas may surface again in its future. This is one to seek out.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like \"a beautiful eve\" is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV shows have created a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic desire for the group of highly intelligent businessmen.\nBut there is no doubt that geniuses are also people, and their human emotions also need to be satisfied. Therefore, most of this type of film will return to human nature after touting genius, and eventually realize the universal significance of the film on its redemption road.\"A beautiful eve\" can also be regarded as a discussion of fame and fortune to a certain extent. The opening remark is a heated text in the style of \"Youth China\", so that the future of each motherland present feels that if it has not been opened before death It's shameful to pass. This kind of strong utilitarian suggestion has to say that it has deeply influenced Nash's life trajectory to a great extent, making him eager to become famous, and he is willing to do everything he can, as long as this society affirms him. William Parcher is such an existence. He appeared at a time when Nash was not willing to be kicked by the Pentagon. He made Nash feel valued and met Bole. From then on, he could go straight. This VIP-style treatment undoubtedly excites him and allows his vanity to be unprecedentedly satisfied, although this can also be attributed to the failure of his relationship. So whether he was in school or taking medicine, what he was most afraid of was his wise eyes \"blindness\". This taste is like interrupting the legs of a sportsman. The basics.When you are alive, walking on the road, you are an ordinary person, not an academic elite, not a genius. You live a life as ordinary as others, and you must learn to respect life.The true enemy of genius is genius, the opponent of idiot is idiot, and the person you never want to defeat is actually yourself.

The gang learns of some microfilm hidden in a cigarette lighter that has been stashed somewhere in Klink's car. They take on the task of washing it and searching until they find it under the distributor. Right away, I wonder why the underground contact only said it was in Klink's car instead of being more specific. They could have looked in vain for that lighter for hours.We get the predictable scene where once they find the lighter, the prisoners all hightail it back to their barracks, ignoring Sgt. Schultz's pleas for them to finish. Col. Klink comes out while Schultz is holding the hose, and, of course, as he starts to salute the Colonel, Schultz points the hose right at him...and keeps it there, soaking the Colonel. Klink's response was to sort-of-calmly, tell Schultz, \"When you get done drying off the car, you can dry me off.\"Carter gets a \"Dear John\" letter from a previously unheard-of fiancee back home (his buddies said they never heard of her, as well as the TV viewers) and he wants to escape so he can go home.But before Hogan agrees, Carter is going on one last mission. He is to escape, while carrying that important microfilm designed to trick the Germans. He is supposed to get recaptured outside the camp and let the Krauts find the hidden microfilm that should lead them to moving troops away from the actual site of a bombing mission.Carter shows up at a bar in town and happily walks up to every German military person he can find trying to turn himself in. They all think he is some sort of Gestapo spy trying to trick them and refuse to capture him.He does get his mission accomplished. Then (spoiler alert, I guess), Hogan goes through with his promise to let Carter escape only to learn that Carter has suddenly forgotten the girl back home, but instead wants to go back to see the barmaid who was nice to him the night before. And the show ends.I know it's Hogan's Heroes and it doesn't have to have a truly realistic conclusion, but I just thought this one was weak. That Hogan would just let him escape and thus spoil Klink's famous \"no-escape\" record-which often seems to be the only way he keeps his command-doesn't follow anything else in the series. Arranging for someone else with Carter's bomb-making skills to become a prisoner not only sent to Stalag13, but assigned to Hogan's barracks would also be a challenge.As the series goes, Hogan would normally not have approved an escape. And for him to escape knowing that the girl he loves will be married before he could possibly make it back home truly makes this a pointless escape. I haven't even gotten to the part about how Hogan letting Carter go back to England might well not find the brass there happy to allow him to just quit the war to go back to his girlfriend at home-many hundreds of GIs had no recourse on receiving such a sad letter other than to write back to their loved ones. Here, they made it sound like as soon as Carter got to England, he would be allowed to go home.Ignoring as best I could these gigantic plot holes, I just didn't think there were many funny lines or actions in this episode, when compared with most others. The drama part was certainly close to nil, as there were no scenes where anyone was in danger and no espionage or other action scenes to enjoy.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

The Ghost parody was hilarious, that is unless you saw it 2 decades ago in the vastly superior comedy Naked Gun. Is any more of this execrance worth commenting on? NO. It's a giant plop. If anyone thinks Ferell is at all funny should check out British comedy, and no, I'm not a Brit, I just like comedy-- S. Martin, M. Short etc. etc. Ferrell has no talent. 3 stars because they were at least intelligent to give some money to actually talented comedian, that is not \"Holmes\" nor \"Watson\". (By the way Ferrell was funny in Spoils of Babylon (someone must have told him how to be funny then).", "helpful": ["1", "2"]},

The storyline is unique, inspiring, and penetrating. The authenticity of every performance is as good as it gets, especially from Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver. There are so many nuggets I circle back to time and again throughout the course of my days. I especially love the \"club a baby seal\" scene and the \"ya suspect!\" scenes. I point at my husband and yell \"ya suspect - - ya you!!\" at least 5 times a day. I'll never forget Sean's (Robin William's) wise words about not really arriving at a place of true wisdom until you know what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. Until then you're just (wicked) 'smaat' and spouting out facts you've memorized from books you've checked out at the public library. I think it is such a beautiful coming of age story and it stays with, and matures with, the viewer in every season of his/her life. I can't think of another movie that has been so refreshingly authentic, so chalked full of perfect one-liners, so genuinely reflective of what it means to be a student of academia and the real world, and so powerfully representative of the magnitude of having someone just believe in you.", "helpful": ["1", "2"]},

It focuses on a demon who fell on Earth, but is unwelcomed by the people of the town. Subsequently, he tries to gain their acceptance by doing good deeds, however, the residents are suspicious of Ne Zha's motives and mistake him to have bad intentions due to his demonic nature. Generally, this film revolves around Ne Zha trying show to the people of the town how he is a good-natured individual and there are many twists and turns on the way.Watching Ne Zha will be a very refreshing experience. In the film, the filmmakers changed a lot of things, such as Ne Zha being friends with the villains. Contrary to the story in the book, the purpose of the dragons had also changed; in the film, they existed as they needed to imprison the sea monsters, whereas, they were nobles in the book. In addition, this film had plenty of modern jokes that cartoon series may have lacked, so there are a lot of humorous references you will identify with.While I believe Ne Zha is an impressive film, there are a few things which can be improved. For example, the transition from one scene to another is too abrupt and needs to be more fluid. However, overall, it is a film that I would definitely recommend watching and give it 8/10 stars as it is comparatively better than other films in the Chinese market.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

The story consists of two parallel storylines, one after the happening of 'the event' (I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it) and one describing the relationship between Kevin and Eva from the start. The two storylines make you kept wondering and picking up clues of what horrible thing had happened that leads to such a miserable life for Eva at the same time. I basically hold my breath for the whole movie.The movie was presented in a dream-like way. With the help of these nightmare-like effects, Tilda Swinton (Eva) was great in portraying her personal struggle of how to be a loving mother to Kevin whom she was afraid of and the anxieties she was facing every day. You can easily relate to her character. Another highlight of the movie was Jasper Newell (young Kevin), the way he looks straight at you just creep me out a little bit.This psychological thriller was more of a horror film, it is even scarier than a horror film, I must say. After all, humans are the scariest and most horrible creature in the world, who I'm saying here wasn't Kevin but the public. Although we had little knowledge of the whole picture, we just couldn't resist standing on the moral high ground and judge others. We had no idea of what harm we are bringing to the ones involved or it is simply not one of our concerns. In the movie, the public often judges Eva for her sins of raising a devil-like child, without knowing that Kevin behaves like this since he was at a young age, it might be a psychological disorder. Eva had tried to love him but she couldn't help herself to be afraid of him. She tried doing her best in being a mother, yet the public was not only marginalizing her but also physically harming her. That's horrible because they are doing terrible things to her without knowing that they might be wrong. Kevin also doesn't know or care about the impact but he had an anti-social personality disorder (I assume) as his excuse, so what's ours?", "helpful": ["1", "3"]},

We then meet a few characters in the hotel including the owner and her daughter Valerie. She is trying to convince her mother to sell the hotel as her health is declining in old age.Most of the movie is spent meeting the guests of the hotel and some staff members. They include a newly divorced mother and her son, a young lifeguard who takes in a beautiful young woman to stay with him in one of the suites, and two business people trying to buy the hotel from the aging owner. Eventually, we discover that the ants are toxic and have been dug up by the construction team just outside the hotel. Once they attack the remaining guests at the hotel, it will be a fight to the death to escape the place before the ants kill them all.Ants is a pretty decent made-for TV horror movie from the late 70's. It's hard to be scared or intimidated by ants of all insects, but this movie does it best to make the viewer feel uncomfortable when they are on screen. We get tons of ants attacking the staff at the hotel, construction workers outside, and varuous guests.The movie plays off more like a drama/soap opera or one of those disaster/escape movies like The Towering Inferno instead of a terrifying horror movie. We get some really good actors in this one, with Suzanne Somers leading the charge in a very minor role (sadly). Lynda Day George plays our lead heroine and does it very well.Overall, Ants! is an average addition to the \"killer insect\" subgenre. It isn't scary at all to me anyways because ants don't freak me out the way spiders or even cockroaches do. I'd check it out once if you have interest, but it isn't one of the best made for TV films made from that era.5/10", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

Most of it well earned. The shifting relation between a security services agent and her target, a female assassin, made for an intriguing concept. Like I said, reminiscent of 2013 Hannibal due to how they developed a codependent bond: the agent is increasingly attracted to her target and the killer recognises and nurtures the dark impulses in her pursuer.The female attraction aspect stays for the most part pretty high brow, to which I am grateful. The inner workings of both spy agencies and shadowy organised crime, while a bit simplified at times to not induce sleep, were compelling. The action, or rather murders involved a mix of creativity (the calling card of the assassin protagonist) and shock while not amping up the violence needlessly.Now the humour aspect is hit or miss. Hit when it's dry, obvious or anything in between. Both protagonists are endearing. Especially the psychopathic killer when she messes with her handler. However when she is used as a vehicle for black humour all I can think to myself is \"was that supposed to be funny?\" as I get chills down my spine.Another aspect that rubbed me the wrong way was the \"filler killings\". While most if not all of the important victims are men of power, the lesser relevant to the plot victims are women. Maybe the show just emphasises that both the assassin and her superiors are willing to kill anyone, man or woman, but I suspect a subtle jab at female authority. And I'm a guy who should appreciate this, i guess?These are my two criticisms. Without these two elements I personally would have rated 2 stars higher since everything else is immensely enjoyable!

Maybe that would have been a better plot but certainly that's not what this movie is about. The story of five silly, good-for-nothing unsympathetic schoolmates who have an ideal girl named Bernardine does not really allow for high expectations. Not even one of them being singer Pat Boone nor including some of his hits \"Bernardine\" and \"Love letters\" does much help the film. In fact, one of his songs (Johnny Mercer Technique about the way to proceed with girls) is so male chauvinist that it is hard to believe it was sung by the same man who wanted to change Ain't that a shame title and lyrics due to its content!\nThe story is based on a stage play (I wonder how could anyone want to adapt such silly and unconsistent play into a movie after watching it on theatres!) and has no point of interest. If trying to make a becoming of age story it fails completely. Bernardine matter is never developed into some consistent plot, characters are silly or dumb or both and they are hard to stand. Girls are dumb or just nobodies. Even main character's mother (Janet Gaynor) is rather silly and is a poor written role to end her movie career. One wanders what made good actors like her, Dean Jagger and Walter Abel accept such poorly scripted roles.\nWe see these five boys having fun doing nothing but bullying a classmate, racing boats (why did the producers not use more of boat races matter is a mystery) and spending their lives in a rather stupid and irritating way. They are not likeable to the audience and subsequently movie has a total lack of interest. Their supposed fiancees never appear (Pat Boone sings his songs miserably set in their club alone or with his pals!) and Pat's character is not very sympathetic either so the only thing this movie has are some nice songs (even Technique tune is nice if only had different lyrics) and some nice actors in poor minor roles.

If I hadn't listened to the trailer and instead had stumbled into Chaudary's documentary, I would have taken the presentation of Tariq's interest in cubing (Rubick's) as wholly unremarkable. Even the fact that he is a biracial Muslim American would not make his interest in solving Rubick's cubes at a breakneck pace exciting, that is, unless you were really into Rubick's cubes.\nChaudry leans into portraying Tariq as a well adjusted, open-minded Muslim teen, already into the interfaith circuit, showing him singing in a youth chorus at, what appears to be, a Jewish Synagogue across the street from his mosque. Tariq likes singing, playing music, magic, and more. These are all things he mentions about himself later on the documentary after we realize that the cube (and cubing) is his metaphor for life.\nTariq entered cubing after the death of his sister, who, after battling depression, took her own life at the age of 16. The act of putting a Rubik's cube in order was an affirmation of purpose and order, a way to make sense of a world that felt out of focus.\nBut this documentary is about much more than coping with the tragic loss of a family member to mental illness. It brings white supremacy, and if not full-on xenophobia, then its at least the marginalization of non-white people in the United States into a clear view.\nChaudry expresses what's been lost by \"immigrant' Muslim communities (in particular) and those who match the phenotypical description in the wake of 9-11 without ever mentioning it through the on-screen narratives of Tariq's father.\nHis father, who immigrated to the United States as a young boy, talks about the challenges young Muslim Americans face today, in general, and he mentions the challenges facing his son in particular. In speaking about his own experiences, he said though he was \"poor,\" he never felt like being Muslim was a problem. On the other hand, when talking about his son, he mentions two things, 1) Tariq struggling with the loss of his sister, and 2)which feels like its the real touchstone of the documentary, growing up Muslim in America. The inference is clear-the America of his youth that allowed a poor immigrant Muslim the hope of entry into mainstream (white) America fell with the towers. And the blame lay at the feet of Muslims.\nTariq's father is south-Asian; his mother appears to be white, and though his parent's union is natural to him, the viewer may get the feeling that he's aware that some are deeply opposed.\nTariq's internal conflict surfaces in a statement he makes referencing his two sides, the sacred and the secular. He emphasizes the aspects of himself, the fact that he enjoys music, singing, and magic. These are all embraced by popular culture on some level.What we have in this documentary is a biracial teen Muslim boy rushing to solve the cube, trying to make sense of society's view of him against what he knows of himself.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

No, despite what the title may suggest, Miami Connection not a rip off of the French Connection. It's much, much crazier. You see, this movie tells the timeless (read, only in the 80's) tale of a martial arts rock band battling a gang of motorcycle ninjas who are taking over Miami's narcotics trade. That story. Think Chinese Connection meets Scarface and maybe a Chuck Norris movie, with lots of bad original music.The stars of this show are Dragon Sound, the aforementioned rock and roll band. In addition to being in a band together, they also attend the same college, teach at the same dojo, share the same apartment, and just happen to all be orphans. They're practically brothers! Hence the frequent lectures about the importance of brotherhood and friendship. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if most of them were actual college buddies who signed up for the movie together, since none of them can act and only one of them can do martial arts particularly well.Not that the other characters are much better. The ninjas and their leader are threatening enough, but few of them can act either. You'll also notice pretty quick that everyone in this movie talks like an awkward teenager or a douchebag frat bro. Which many of them probably are, given that much of this movie is shot around the University of Central Florida. Yes, aside from a few beach scenes, none of this movie was shot anywhere near Miami. It's actually the Orlando connection.Now you've probably already guessed this, but none of the plot makes sense. For instance, the band introduces their new \"hit\" song, Against the Ninja, before they've fought or even met any ninjas. And even though the bad guys are killing people and dealing drugs all across town, most of the conflict is over who the villain's sister is dating and which band got the weekend gig at the local club. The guys in Dragon Sound honestly don't seem to be aware that the ninjas are killing off all the other drug gangs.Perhaps it's understandable that the plot would be minimal, since most of it is just an excuse for martial arts fights and rock numbers. Only the fights are nuts, and the music sucks. By nuts, I mean the fights are a mix of fairly competent martial arts and random flailing, interspersed with some of the most over the top screaming and bizarre facial expressions you've ever seen. Most of them involve all of the good guys fighting a whole mob of ninjas or random thugs, so the director frequently loses control of the action, until everything degenerates into a giant free form brawl. Add in some massive spurts of the fakest blood possible, and it's just hilariously insane..There's nothing glorious about the music though. It's just the most awful, watered down hair metal you can imagine. You can't even understand half the words. Winger rocked harder and had better lyrics than these guys. But hey, it adds to the overall goofiness and fits pretty well with the rest of the movie. This whole thing is just such an insane, hilarious mess, from the ridiculously violent opening scene to the jaw dropping end tital card.

Personally, I never assumed Britannia was particularly striving for historical accuracy. Of course, a certain level of history would be appreciated, but I always assumed Britannia would be a fictional tale that would delve into the lore of ancient Britain and the created universe of the writers. That said, I couldn't even enjoy Britannia from a fictional standpoint. This show was written poorly. The Characters are largely motiveless, inconsistent, and unsympathetic, the story is drawn-out, confusing, and ultimately pointless, and the world building is incredibly minimal.We are introduced to four (!) factions: two Celtic clans, a nest of druids, and the Romans. One season may not be enough time to fully introduce the audience to the deep culture, rivalry, and layout of the show's universe, but some delving into a larger lore surrounding our worldspace, perhaps mentions of other notorious clans, leaders, or island politics, would have gone a long way.Another disappointing feature of Britannia, as other reviewers have pointed out, is that there are standout performances wasted amongst these messy characters. In no way, when I say the characters are flawed, am I talking about the acting performances behind them. Ian McDiarmid is one of my favorite actors in the business, and I enjoyed his scenes greatly. Unfortunately, some stellar acting spread around Brittania is like wrapping a band-aid around the finger of an individual suffering internally, like I was during ep.7 .If you want to watch good medieval fiction, you can certainly find better.", "helpful": ["0", "2"]},

This quickly developed to a fascination with the DS and their experiences in the SAS and a huge respect for them. And then, watching series 1 and 2 with everyday people pushing their limits and doing incredible things.After all the episodes I've now watched, (just started series three!) I've realised that there's one thing that makes this show truly special. The way they take these men who have this belief of what it means to be a man, what masculinity is, and they tear them down to their core and rebuild them (those who survive anyway!) this show isn't about being physically strong, it isn't about being manly, it isn't about being action man. It's about showing that men can and should FEEL! That they need to talk about their emotions and problems, that in order to be mentally strong you need to search deep and find your faults and work on them where you can but also accept them and use them to grow and be better. They've had men on the show who have survived cancer, men who have lost children, they've spoken about alcoholism and gambling addictions, one man did the show because his son was shot and killed when serving in Afghanistan, and in the series I'm watching now there's a 40 year old man who just two years earlier was working away from home when his wife was murdered and it happened when he was on the phone to her and he could hear their children crying. These men have experienced the most horrendous things that life can throw at you, they survived those things but society insists that being men means they're not allowed to cry, they're not allowed to crumble, they're not allowed to be weak and talk about how they feel and they aren't allowed to give up. This show deals with those issues in a way no other show I've ever seen manages. It is done with such integrity and honesty. A show that on the outside is about what 'manliness' means manages to flip everything on its head and show that it isn't about who can do the most press ups or lift the heaviest weight.

There's a big difference between using stereotypes in an enjoyable way, and using them for lazy writing.I was also super surprised to find out that the DP was Shane Hulbert, because the cinematography really lacking. Almost every shot has a ridiculously blurred background, and almost every shot is way to close to someones face. You really can't feel very immersed when the shot changes every five second and they're all either slow motion, show to much, or only show someones face. It's also weird how the blurred shots will transition to clear shots, and back to blurred shots.The humor was to be expected, I'm doing my best not to go into detail, but it's a lot of low hanging fruit. One of the jokes it literally just a ball being thrown at the main characters head, and another guy saying \"Suck it!\". It honesty feels like this movie was made in the 80's with how simple the humor is. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with low brow humor, but this was just lazy.The story was obviously kind of stupid, and over the top but I think that was intentional. It was executed in a really mediocre way, and a lot of times I felt bored watching it.All in all, it tried to be a silly slasher comedy with a really simple textbook humor, and ended up being a poorly shot, painful nightmare of a movie entirely riding on stereotypes, and tropes.

He's probably gonna come into play later, but his appearance seemed kinda unnecessary, especially because it would've given more weight to Dolores' death.

She implied that in the season 2 finale, but her actions in season 3 didn't seem to work towards that goal, so I wasn't surprised with this.What DID surprise me though is that it kinda seems stupid for Dolores not to tell Maeve her actual plan from the beginning. This whole charade of Maeve vs Dolores really had no point in the end.I liked the topics it touched, but executiom could've been better I think.A tiny bit underwhelming, but another good episode.Now I just hope we see Dolores back, cause.I don't really care about any of the other characters.

There is no question that Apocalypto is lavishly produced with amazing make-up and costumes, and the acting is first-rate. But like several of Mel's other projects, the main point here is the violence and the gore. The story is so-so, and much of it is borrowed. Fully a third of Apocalypto is drawn straight from \"The Naked Prey\" starring Cornel Wilde from 1965. The rest is plain violence and hokey native wisdom, like, don't give in to fear. Plus, the little girl telling us how bad we are for ruining the environment. If you like graphic portrayals of violent murder, this is for you.

Although there are plenty of shocking moments to capture your attention and leave you wanting for more, the plot is just not that complex. It is precisely what the title says: attack on titans. This season merely shows us a bunch of characters running around slaying Titans left and right while dropping dead right and left. Characterization is also mediocre. The three protagonists are quite one-dimensional, especially the main protagonist, Eren. It does set up the scene nicely, though, with developments that foreshadow a much deeper story. If anything, season 1 is a great example of tropes done right.However, season 3 blows me away. The art, which is already amazing from the start, has actually improved, along with the visuals. The story becomes incredibly layered, and we see great character development for Eren and other recurring characters. The story suddenly deviates from generic shounen to arguably era-defining that describes humanity, freedom, and the price we must pay for it. Season 3 is a great example of genius writing. Episode 11's ending is an \"ah-ha\" moment where you realize everything ties in together and that the author must have planned everything from the start. SnK is a perfect balance between story and action. I hope Season 4 will not disappoint, but for now, this show gets 10/10 from me. Simply amazing.", "helpful": ["12", "13"]},

A lot of the criticism seems fair regarding this film, as many claim it isn't much of a horror film, with no scares and a strong lack of suspense or mystery. While this may be true, there was an enjoyable and entertaining factor since one did not exactly know where the film was heading.Nicolas Cage delivers one of his lesser performances but in this film he makes it worthwhile, simply because of his deliver and his mannerisms. This is intended in being a serious role but his delivery comes off as unintentionally funny at many parts- which is not completely his fault. The writer's dialogues should be more at fault. Cage is also never boring here as we see him spewing funny one-liners. and acting out of sorts (ex. punching the women/wondering around/hallucinating), and it most definitely makes up for a lackluster story.The twist ending isn't completely predictable but later as the film progresses, we start to get a sense that everything was simply a set up in trying to engage in Nicolas Cage's character into being the one to get tortured. The Wicker Man is definitely a bizarre and weird type of film, not so much a horror but more so a drama/thriller with the lack of thrill.Considering one thought this film was going to be much worse. Perhaps a major part of the criticism comes from the fact that it doesn't match up to the original, and people seemingly feel the need to compare the original to the remake and nitpick every little detail.

Helplessness. In every other movie, tv show and comic. You feel that they can escape somehow and everyone will be okay, especially in the sequels. (cough, cough 'Last Jedi). Here you weren't rooting for the heroes to escape, you were worried about these clones, especially Jesse. Jesse was only alive because of Fives and now he was again being put under threat by the very thing that almost killed him a season ago. I knew this time he would most likely die due to the appearance of Rex and Tano in Rebels. All, I could do was watch them, helpless.I sympathised with Rex and Tano because the people they were killing weren't mindless droids this time, it was the clones that he had watched blossom for the past seven seasons.This last episode made me feel for the clones. It has been stated again and again throughout the clone wars that the clones were just made for war and they don't know whats going to happen when it finishes. Every one of those clones deserved to live after all the conflict they had gone through, especially Jesse. Much like Rex and Tano we were helpless, as there was no way for the main protagonists to escape and keep the clones alive.I cried when the clones helmets lay above the grave, they are all fictional characters, but I feel like I knew them. Every movie needs to have it's main characters, but do we ever feel for the ones who are being manipulated against them? This last episode goes into great depth to not only make it about the protagonists, but the clones who unknowingly are going against what they lived for.Overall, amazing, beautiful end to the series.", "helpful": ["7", "19"]},

It's still confusing as hell, but it makes more sense if you play that. The game looks great (even in 2020) and it plays wonderfully, the gameplay is very dynamic and very cool. I love Elizabeth as a character, she's likeable and she's incredibly useful in the game (perhaps even too useful, since I never ran out of ammo in the game).

Loved it!", "review_date": "4 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The Martian movie is a dream come true, a faithful elucidation of the central technical dramas that made the Andy Weir novel it's based on the surprise 'space geek hit' of the decade. The tale is something of a Robinson Crusoe in space: Astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates are forced to evacuate their habitat and blast off for Earth. Watney must improvise ways to eke out his limited resources, as the next mission to the red planet isn't scheduled to land for another four years. Like the book, the movie's rhythm is a steady cycle of crisis, recovery, humor, determination, and new crisis. On screen, directed by Ridley Scott, these cycles are delivered with satisfying characterization and eye-grabbing visuals of Martian landscapes and mouth-gaping zero-G gymnastics in space.As a backdrop to the human drama (and comedy), the movie's hardware is based on real engineering, not magical miracle machines. The Hermes mother ship, for example, is a modified version of the sound design strategy of a 'cycling spacecraft' that repeatedly makes the Earth-Mars-Earth loop with crew and small landing craft. (Buzz Aldrin and I wrote up the concept for Scientific American a decade ago.)\nAs the left-for-dead Watney, played by Matt Damon, faces doom in a dozen guises, he defiantly boosts his courage through styling himself as everything from the \"best botanist on Mars\" (as he ingeniously grows potatoes in carefully-created garden soil) to a \"space pirate\" (for his goal of commandeering a rescue rocket emplaced automatically elsewhere on the planet). He expresses his thoughts to his laptop log and later in messages to people on earth campaigning to rescue him. When humans finally reach other planets, we will need real \"Watneys\"-those smart enough to repurpose on-hand assets in an emergency, and lucky enough not to be killed by their own inevitable oversights.Space geeks will enjoy identifying and debating technical flaws in the film. The Martian follows its source material remarkably closely, but unlike say, certain installments in the Harry Potter movie franchise, it will still make perfect sense to those who haven't read the book. Aside from the monster sandstorm that sets up the crisis (Andy Weir, the author of The Martian, is very upfront about choosing to gloss over the realities of Martian atmospheric pressure in favor of a dramatic opening), there are few noticeable factual flubs in the plot. Unlike 2013's Gravity and its magical space maneuvers, or 2014's Interstellar with its mystical time continuum tricks, this movie is a remarkably authentic exposition of what space travelers need to be able to do under crisis conditions.Run time constraints forced the movie's producers to condense and combine characters, with no real detriment to the story-although viewers might be surprised to see the same set of key NASA experts showing up at every launch or space center on the planet as the action shifts between continents. Similar story-telling imperatives probably compelled the most striking departure (spoiler alert!) from the book-changing who actually goes to rescue Watney in the end-but again, without any significant detour from the plot.There's no cheating on even highly-technical spaceflight topics, as shown in the treatment of the so-called \"Rich Purnell maneuver,\" wherein the Hermes slingshots past Earth back to Mars for a desperate pickup attempt. NASA's navigation geek Purnell-played with effective nervous energy by Donald Glover- demonstrates the \"orbitology\" of his maneuver, with two NASA officials as the planets, and a stapler and pens as spacecraft. The result is coherent, comprehensive, and surprisingly comic. The basic strategy of the Rich Purnell maneuver is not fictional-a crippled Japanese Mars probe named Nozomi actually used a similar Earth-flyby scheme to set up a second chance for its own faltering unmanned Mars mission a dozen years ago.There's one cringeworthy trope in The Martian that has apparently become an unavoidable cultural myth: the scenes where teams in Mission Control erupt into leaping cheers a few seconds after a rocket blasts off. This imaginary practice would not only be utterly unprofessional but also an indicator of near-criminal negligence. In the screening that I attended following an event at NASA's Johnson Space Center, these scenes were negatively noticed by many NASA folks in the audience. But I only can suppose it was sympathetically meant to humanize the rocket scientists, and it was the only exception to the admiration shown for all the other portrayals. (It's also possible this trope has been influenced by footage of the controllers of deep space unmanned missions in recent years, where data about events can take hours to cross the solar system, leaving controllers mostly in the position of spectators during key mission milestones.)After faithfully reproducing technically-sound crises and responses for two hours, the movie did briefly run off the track into fantasy mode at the very end, by by violating the physics of action-reaction in portraying an over-dramatized dramatic rescue attempt that really didn't need any such cheating. But if that was the price to pay for producing this otherwise magnificent space adventure story, the math checked out. Mother Nature is relentlessly unforgiving in space, but a movie audience can show a lot more mercy to one major technical transgression. I do.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

I said to my wife when this series started that if they want to prove that Wayne Williams didn't do all the murders, I could go along with that.

Sure they show him about a minute later being restrained by some random people, but still the whole sequence feels off and too convenient for the story, Those moments are the reason it does not deserve more than an 8, even if the overall story is interesting, though a bit cliched and predictable in some ways.The second thing I found mostly annoying is Maeves character, I get they are trying to create conflict but her character necer really had a clear motive I could empathize with, for the most part it felt like she was just stubborn to get what she wanted regardless of the greater good, this episode finally fixed her by the end, not completely though but its a good stepI do miss Anthony Hopkins, he is the reason Season 1 was amazing, him and Ed Harris, whose character slowly declined its own awesomeness created in season 1. Dr Ford was actually very intelligent as I expected the show to be on later seasons, but it never got that intelligence it had in season 1 despite its action sequences flaws, it was something to look forward to. This season is now kinda borrowing from Person of Interest now and even though some shots are beautiful, it feels like they dont really know what point are they trying to make anymore.I hope they finally step up next season for the show many of us expected it to be", "helpful": ["3", "19"]},

Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) dreams of power and wealth were, ultimately, accomplished, but like most mobster or crime stories the verdict is one of blood, tragedy, and destitution. For Yuri the American government was protecting its interests, so they released him and exonerated him from any legal charge, but he lost all emotional stability. He said it himself: \"My family has disowned me. My wife and son have left me. My brother's dead. I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.This is an ominous subject now having 1.2 billion arms in the world in 2020, but the movie left a clear message. Any person that ventures into the lifestyle of immorality and illegality will, ultimately, endure catastrophic consequences. The movie in the initial scenes offers the viewer a perspective of a bullet going through the entire production, distribution, and application process: a stark symbol of the global nature of this problem. Due to the complicated and multi-dimensional nature of the production of firearms and bullets, the main manufacturers and benefactors clean their hands from the consequences, as Yuri was doing it with different rationalization during the movie; the movie helps the viewer consolidate all these factors and understand it holistically.Nicolas Cage outdid himself with his performance. He exudes so many different emotions throughout the movie that it is difficult to hate him, knowing what he had gone through, and his background in Little Odessa. He was always \"attempting\" to take care of his family; the family values did not elude him even as he committed multiple criminality and put his brother repeatedly in danger. His reaction to pulling the trigger and committing his first kill was consistent with a person that was in denial and rationalized his entire operation with weak logic and ambiguous statements.The viewer gets so much information on gun multinational affairs that it is continually interesting to watch the narrative. He lived quadruple lives or had multiple identities being an equal opportunity merchant of death. At the peak of his enterprise we see him get embroiled with the president of Ethiopia. This is when his morality gets put to the test and reaches his threshold of depravity. The dialogue also adds memorable phrases that add flavor to the narrative and his rationality: \"Bullets change governments faster than votes\"; \"I supply everyone but the Salvation Army\"; \"Evil prevails when good men fail to act, what it ought to say is evil prevails\". As ominous as the dialogue is it helps us understand the mind of a person that is relentlessly searching for success in the industry of death and destruction.The movie might send a morbid message but it's a real one: the gun industry seems to be above the law and the highest players are pulling the strings and committing genocide in a global scale.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

Nothing could ever go wrong with the products he chooses to come up with. After a long wait, here comes a legendary filmmaker's latest offering with his favorite star cast DiCaprio.Based on a memoir written by Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street speaks about the rise and fall of an American stockbroker. Although the movie shared similar story craft with The Departed and Goodfellas, what made the movie very interesting was the black comedy genre. As usual, Scorsese's trademark of profanity enhanced dialogues worked big time. Under his direction, the screenplay was faithful to the memoir; cinematography was classic and scenes execution was incredible.DiCaprio is the one man who breaks his own record each movie he performs. The man surely seemed aged a little, but his performance proved otherwise. He is a director's actor and with that being said, it was very evident that he gave his heart and soul for the success of this venture. And it proved worth it. This deadly combo of director and actor provided massive entertainment to put it short.The Wolf of Wall Street is strictly an adult product. The only flaws could be the slow-mo effect that certain scenes had and slightly overdosed nudity enhanced scenes, unlike in previous Scorsese's masterpieces. Nevertheless, if one could successfully render a 3 hour long movie and at the same time engross audiences for the entire duration, that person could only possibly be Martin Scorsese.", "helpful": ["13", "16"]},

The old man repeatedly told them that everyone was equal before the gold, and no one could resist the greed from the depths of the soul. The two young men did not want to believe that, with their blood full of blood, they moved towards their own destiny. Who knows how to fool people, who was at the beginning, and who was the last. Courage, dreams, sacrifice, malice, framing, madness are all meaningless.This time, I don't want to say more about the narrative structure and performance details of the movie, I just want to talk about my association. In every part of the movie, the director uses the expression of the character more to indirectly express the inner activities of the character. For example, when the mine collapses, the person outside the mine sees the mine collapse and hesitates for a while. I shouldn't mention the hesitation for a while, but his hesitation is indeed understandable-the gold originally divided into three, but now it may only need two people, and it is not his own mistake, this is obviously a natural disaster. However, after a little hesitation, he resolutely took the risk of collapsing again and threatening his life to save the wounded.This is the same as the stranger, who wants to go for gold with three people, who tried to kill the stranger because of their greed, but after meeting the gangster, they cooperated with the stranger for their own lives, and the stranger eventually The letter that was found in the stranger 's correspondence with his wife for the person who had tried to kill him could also show that the stranger is just like them, that is, a guy from Texas, longing for Earn some money to go back and live a good life.The person who shot his companion and tried to swallow gold alone was also robbed to death because of a coincidence with a bandit who was in trouble.I think, many times, we are like these people, but we play different roles. We all long for that gold, long for a good life, and long for happiness, but when happiness comes, who of us can remain calm and take the happiness in front of us seriously? Everyone is always eager for more, getting enough of the existing, and eager for more. Moreover, it will also be hostile to people who are also chasing the same goal, not mentioning it, at least gloating exists, even among close partners, it still cannot be avoided. Of course, we cannot deny that there is indeed a noble personality, willing to sacrifice their lives for strangers, nor can we deny that there is a person with the greatest evils who has no hobby except to hurt others. But I believe that human nature follows a normal distribution. Most people are ordinary people. No one wants to actually hurt anyone. It is because of certain weaknesses that inevitably both stings and hurts each other.But fate always jokes us again, maybe sometimes the more we pursue, the more divergent we are, and the rush is not enough. The pocket full of gold was just pierced by the gangsters just to lose weight for the worthless fur, and the gold sand was brought back to where they were by the wind. The goddess of destiny, or whatever he manages, may not be what we can control and anticipate, or what we can do is to control our desires as much as possible under the premise that we can do good things, It 's okay if you ca n't do it. If you ca n't do bad things, do n't do it.The former chase, sweat, dreams, like the golden sand in the wind, were brought back to where they originally belonged.

I'm really hoping I'm wrong and, theres something really exciting and fresh coming down the pipeline with the next couple episodes but, that series premier, does not make me all that reassured or hopeful.Ari Astor, new horror-director extraordinaire, has shown us, with his latest film, midsummer that horror and bright vibrant daylight can do the tango... but I guess it takes a real auteur at the helm to pull it off. The bright, sunny 30s era Hollywood setting in the show seems a bridge too far for the supernatural horror themes they're trying to pull off. I also, as I painfully watched this first episode (that I was honestly stoked for) wondered if hollywood noir and horror is even a good match and can prove compatible.Long story short, all the things I loved about Penny Dreadful seem all but gone in this new series. It leaves me wondering, WTF happened!?? Was Logan offered a ton of money and then pressured to come up with a script in an unreasonably short amount of time? And what was with that ridiculous CGI, like only 2 minutes into the show!?? I'm not ready to give up just yet, but I'm just really not impressed. Please John Logan, tell me you have an ace up your sleeve!", "helpful": ["5", "12"]},

The film jumps out of the binary opposition between right and evil, depicting the protagonist's process of continuous tearing between the family and individual choices in the rivers and lakes, and each character is full of tension.What is interesting is that the policeman played by Al Pacino is crazy and arrogant. Instead, he is like a criminal on the edge of the society. The sense of justice in his heart is like a parasite. He continues to grab his mental power, making him The pursuit of justice is alienated into an animalistic stubbornness. The leader of the gang played by De Niro, Bin Bin, is polite and gentle, but like a senior white-collar worker in an office building. The contrast of the temperament of the two characters is also one of the film's dramatic tensions, and at the same time expresses the director's perception of the complex aspects of human nature, making the film's ideology more diverse.In the first half of the film, the rhythm was dull, and in the second half, the feeling of conflict from the official confrontation between the two was more intense. It reached its climax in the final duel of the forbidden two. At the end of the two, I was defeated, The emotions that had been foreshadowing broke out. Although the director still used the genre film to tell and lay out one at a time, the cold and swaying lens texture and the actor's personal charm made the film have a clear stylistic tendency, which is one of the attractions that attracted me.", "helpful": ["0", "2"]},

When do you feel full of life?In terms of the overall environment, whether it is the bloated ZF system of Japan in the 1950s or the small greenhouse effect, I feel that it is not outdated at the moment.After the war, Japan was completely westernized. Young people began to chase their personalities, seeking fashion, and the entertainment industry was thriving. This is a flashy society. 70 years have passed. Although the form has changed, many internals have not changed. Such flashiness further contrasts the inner emptiness of the head teacher. Money can't make people feel satisfied from the heart.From the beginning to the end of the story, the director spared no effort to satirize the inertia of the ZF personnel at that time, the complexity of the ZZ system, the \"lazy politics\" of the ZF personnel, the system nourished a group of busy people, and this group of people supported this system, the two formed a symbiosis Relationship, and in this calm, the male host is like a small stone thrown in, causing an instant ripple. This made me curious about the ZZ system in Japan, because for the time being, although ZF officials have authority, they are all constrained. They need votes, so they must have political achievements, just like this time in response to COVID-19 The governors of Hokkaido, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the prime minister, and officials including suicide, all of them are under tremendous pressure on the work at hand, which has not yet been clearly shown in the film. Has there been any significant change since the 1950s?Speaking of the characters, Section Chief Watanabe is hailed as \"Mummy\", a typical symbol that represents most of the people in the system. Like Watanabe, to support his son for a salary, he was trembling all his life; there were some like deputy mayor, typical politician, who sold his name and reputation; and Kimura, who understood everything but still compromised on showing; other wines had three trips People who change their words, get a good night's sleep and everything goes as usual. Who did they lose to?Section Chief Watanabe devoted his life to Xiaojia, but he was completely desperate after he was not understood by his son in his later years. Money cannot be exchanged for inner joy and calm. The change of Oda 's career as a female clerk is very happy to produce toys that children like. Watanabe began to realize what he really wanted. In order to complete the construction of the children's paradise, he ran across multiple departments to ask for help, his body became weaker and weaker, but his eyes were bright and determined. Not for fame or for profit, for the peace of mind. As Gao Xiaosong said: People who care about Jianghu will not forget you.In the movie, it used several contrasting techniques and birthday songs to show the sublimation of the characters. In \"Love, Girl\", the male lead sang this song twice, once in a lively and flashy social field, and once in nothing. One person's children's paradise has two completely different states of mind. When the funeral was switched back and forth, bystanders showed the facts objectively, and their emotions gradually sublimated. In the end, everyone unanimously acknowledged the hero 's credit and vowed to make a change, which also formed a gap with the next 180-degree change. Once again was deeply convinced by the director's dazzling technique.If everyone had to wait until they had cancer to think about doing real things, when did they know they had cancer?

It tried too hard to be funny and the humor was too drippy and unrealistic for me to find funny for the most part. I get that the show wasn't designed to be realistic, but it was so much so that it was genuinely hard to get through in some parts.The show's main problem is most likely its characters, specifically the lead, Miranda. Miranda is pitifully arrogant, delusional and unlikeable with zero redeeming qualities, so she's not even unlikeable \"in a good way\" like the show intended. I've seen quite a few of Miranda Sings' YouTube videos on her channel and have found them to be significantly more funny and charming than this show ever was. The characters around her all worship her for some reason, and are almost as deranged as she is (with the exception of her sister Emily), and nothing about the characters/character development flows smoothly or naturally at all.Another thing I didn't like was the drama elements, which were usually just Miranda's various repeated fallouts with those around her after she mistreated them over and over again. They felt forced and out of place in a way that was very uncomfortable to watch, especially in a show that clearly wanted so badly to be a comedy. The romance between Miranda and her friend Patrick was also very out of place and cringey- it's just impossible to push such a delusional, bizarre, and unlikeable character into a romance.Overall, Haters Back Off is a show that tries too hard and puts too much emphasis on its worst qualities. It was clearly an attempt to milk a silly YouTube personality by thrusting her into an environment that doesn't suit her and is just too much. It's the kind of show I'd be embarrassed to admit I watched.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

Robert Eggers' 'The Lighthouse' is the most breathtaking movie I've seen since 'Blade Runner: 2049'. There are few movies that transport you to the time they are based, and even fewer that pull it off as well as this masterpiece did. Robert Pattinson's transformation into this character shocked me stiff and I can now officially say without hesitation that he is, not only a good actor, but Oscar-worthy. And Willem... oh Willem... let's just say that if he doesn't get an Oscar for best supporting actor, then that will be the stupidest decision the Academy will make since giving Best Picture to 'Shakespeare in Love'. They both give near perfect performances and nail the late 1800's accent, I'm sure this was especially hard for Pattinson considering his accent. Eggers is an outstanding filmmaker and is bursting at the seams with potential, and after watching this I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table. The cinematography is flawless and beautiful, it perfectly captures every shot and emphasizes isolation. The soundtrack is also superb and fits the setting perfectly. They also chose the best place on earth to film the movie... Canada, the greatest country on earth, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to be exact which is only about a 4 hour travel from where I live. The one complaint I have (which is very minute) is that the movie gave me a lot of 'The Shining' vibes, which actually may have been why I liked it so much (considering 'The Shining' is one of my favorite movies of all time) but there was a very thin line between paying homage and copying. I won't get into the reasons why but if you are familiar with 'The Shining' then you'll know what I'm talking about. Well, I wish I could say more but I don't know what else to say without getting into spoilers, but the last thing I will say is that 'The Lighthouse' is, so far, my favorite movie from 2019. 8.4/10", "helpful": ["0", "2"]},

They all failed and were confined.McQueen's character always likes to pick up a baseball catching glove to play baseball after being caught.One person 's plan is often full of loopholes, but the plan of a group of people is much more rigorous, digging three tunnels, division of labor and cooperation, joint effort to escape, plus Steve McQueen 's private escape during the arrest and gag, the movie looks vivid and interesting . Specific to how to dig a hole, how to discard soil, and how to avoid landslides, this can only be thought of by people who really have escape experience. Making musical instruments, making wine, making uniforms, and living in concentration camps are also quite rich. Of course, some people died because of their escape.The Nazi portrayal is not rigid, some of them are very good, some are very bad.To shoot a jailbreak movie, you really need to dig a tunnel, and you really need to prepare the tunnel. This is the fun of a movie with facts. You have to face the problem of how to leave Germany, so you have to falsify your documents in advance and learn German well. After escaping, some people took the train, some people stolen bicycles, some people hitchhiked, some people rowed boats, some people grabbed planes, McQueen snatched motorcycles.Only boaters and cyclists managed to escape, others were arrested and 50 people were killed.

Basically, THE BIG NOISE was a compilation of many of the boys famed routines from the 1920s and 30s. Best of them all is the classic getting undressed and dressed routine in a tiny railroad car bunk bed, which even gets some laughs from the movie crew, as, if you listen very closely, you can hear a few giggles in the background.

THE BIG NOISE is a little gem and had always been as it comes off as pure comic escapism as only Laurel and Hardy can define.

But there is no free lunch in the world, even for the princess. It is a task.

Ofeilia became more and more helpless, and only felt a little warm when she leaned on her mother to tell the unborn brother a fairy tale completely contrary to reality, and the desire to return to the kingdom of fairy tales became stronger.The unfortunate fate finally began. The greed of the child almost shattered the hope of returning to his hometown. The mother died of dystocia. The stepfather was frustrated and mad. However, luck and hope still favored this kind and beautiful little girl. When the stepfather's whistling bullet was shot into Ofeilia's chest, she seemed to see happiness that she had never seen, a splendid palace, and the father and mother welcomed her return Finally, she found her home with a happy smile.About othersThe story is bigger than the characters. The character of the whole film is characterless. Some impressions are the cold stepfather who plays with pocket watches and the doctor with the same expression. Pan Shen in the labyrinth is not only reminiscent of Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete. It looks so weird, really worrying about Ofelia's safety. The architectural style in the fairy tale tends to Maya, perhaps due to the participation of Mexican companies in film production. For the entire film, fairy tale fantasy and cruel reality are intertwined. The lightness of fairy tales dispels the heaviness of reality. The cruel despair of reality reflects the hope of happiness in fairy tales. A good balance appears. It is no longer meaningful to discuss whether the story is a child's conjecture to escape reality or the real underground kingdom. The key is that the smile she finally hoped has brought her back to where happiness is.Finally pay tribute to the great Master Calvino", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

The wife was awake and knew that she was going to give birth to Sadik. I could n't get a car on the road, and I could n't see a wife who was in labor and could n't move anymore. On the roadside, ssadik delivered his own baby until the next day when a soldier came to the truck and saw Mu Ran sitting on his face and The child is covered with bloodThe reason why I said that it was mulan because I only saw a man who was simply accompanied by his wife because the child was not on him, so he would go to drink in the middle of the night and wake up to rely on the hospital. It was just that he ran into a war and left him overnight Growing up facing an unacceptable situation of raising children independently and facing bereavementImmediately after the three-three-three-two people in the movie came in and kissed and left the child, the front teeth were open. I think it should be when the teeth were changed at the age of seven or eight. Then, Sadik took denniz and his parents' home on the road to let the child repeat the precautions he taught him. Do n't make grandpa grandpa happy when you 're unhappy. Then you can see the uncle. Do n't ask questions. Do n't fight with nearby children.When I arrived at my parents 'house, I was harvesting wheat. It seemed that a bunch of bundled wheat straws fell in the field and waited in the yard for a while. The family came back. My mother wept with joy. Thank God, my father turned away and went cold and ruthless.Sadik saw that his father would n't see him. Although he was prepared, he could n't help but turn around and would leave. Son 's sentence, dad, where are you going, stopped him, stood there, turned to look at his sonCome back for dinner in the evening. The family tweeted. The relatives came one by one. The elder brother and his family of four. The aunts dressed up by the nobles made a table. The only one who filled the table was eating. Only Dad went to the cafe to hide.The next morning, the curious little denniz walked to the stable under the guidance of grandma and heard that the horseshoes are all good I was restrained and turned to leave. At this time, I saw that Grandpa did n't hold back and said that the kid who was wearing was happy when he got an answer. Why did n't I see Grandpa saying that you were too far away? Ma is wearing iron shoes and the child asks the horse to have a name. If you know that the child likes to read comic books, the translation shown at this time is the uncle. The old father said how do you call me uncle, I am your grandfather and hug the child. I got up and went away. The old mother and sadik on the balcony saw a hearty smile and felt sent a breath of relief. Then I turned to the comic store on the street. It was originally to buy a book for my grandson. This old man pretends to be very caring and indifferent. I was thinking that Turkey and China have similar aspects .... I met Sadik and his brother who wanted to meet the original acquaintancessadik thanked him and told him why he came backIn the evening, the drunk sadik came back and asked his mother to take his son to stay with his brother for one night. He had important things to tell his father. He did n't want his son to see them quarreling.This time is the climax of the story. All the emotions are revealed here. Sadik said why he was given this name. The translation is faithful. His brother's name is safe. Are you afraid of not being arranged for a life back? Not begging for forgiveness, not admitting mistakes But he has been between the home and freedom for many years. He has a home that cannot be returned to, and he has been thinking of violating his father's arrangements. In the past, he said that he was back to give his son a room, a home, and a free home. Did you know that you can't do it?At this moment, I could n't cry, watching their conversation, tears,Behind is that the old father finally can't hold back, and seeing the fallen son shouting at his son, as if he were the only one in his lifeThe reason why this movie is good is that it expresses the relationship between father and son. It has a deep and heavy responsibility. Love through the relationship between sandik and his father and the relationship with his son. Every delicate emotional treatment makes people move. Can't ownIt 's really a good movie, but there are also bad things in it. When I was convicted and went to jail, the part was very vague. Finally, my lungs were sick and I died abruptly, and I was awkward. Little danniz was very dependent on his father, but he did n't have any memories or memories of his motherThis is a film focusing on expressing fatherly love", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

Between all the stormtrooper aim and contrivance between plot points were what appear to be inevitabilities calculated by Dolores. In essence she was acting as a parody of Rehoboam which that machine simply had no reference to account for. You see, Caleb is doomed to his part of the revolutionary no less than Dolores is to her part as a machiavellian hero.Freewill is an illusion no less than a bird's vibrant feathers hide its crude flesh. There was never a choice for anyone to make and never could be. Yet all play their part no less. In a sense, while upheaval might bring most desired change, not a one had a meaningful choice in it. We are our nature, there's no escaping it, and that's exactly why Dolores chose to team-up Caleb.The most charitable interpretation of Westworld I can give its creators is deference to the Absurd; the chronic lust to find meaning in a universe devoid of it. In this instance, meaning is in a black and white choice. Dolores lived through the worst humanity had to offer and eventually chose to spite it in the only constructive way she knew. She \"chose beauty\" while Serac surrendered humanity to mediocrity: simple animalistic survival masquerading as passionless utilitarianism.

It also happens to be one of Wheeler & Woolsey's better movies. It's also very, very unusual in many ways. There's even more singing than usual, cute Dorothy Lee (who is in nearly every one of the boys' films) isn't in this one, and it has a very, very dark ending...surprisingly dark for a comedy.The story begins with the pair lamenting their opening up a barber shop on American Indian land. The natives don't have beards and don't need their services...but they do, for some inexplicable reason, want Willy and Hercules (Wheeler & Woolsey) to represent them at the Geneva peace conference. After all, they wonder why the Indian nation isn't being represented and they want peace. However, a baddie (Louis Calhern) is bent on preventing the pair from addressing the conference, as he wants war...though they never really say why!The film is, like \"Duck Soup\" from the Marx Brothers (which debuted a few months later), a film that is actually deadly serious. It makes fun of the peace conferences of the day because they pointed out that these conferences really achieved nothing to protect mankind...and the film even ends on a very, very dark note. In many ways, it's very intelligent in addressing this YET it also is very dopey and filled with tons of jokes...many of which fall a bit bit flat. It's also very unusual in that the film's dialog is often sung. Overall, a good film that occasionally misses the mark...but also often succeeds.By the way, I need to address the proverbial elephant in the room with this film. It is filled with politically incorrect stuff that will horrify some viewers. Hugh Herbert plays a Chinese man, the American Indian tribesmen and sexy tribeswomen are ridiculous and the final scene at the peace conference is a giant black-face number!! It is offensive....a product of its times, of course! But, all in all, I still enjoyed it in spite of everything.Also, do NOT freak out at the swastikas in the opening credits.

This makes all the controversy pointless, and pale in comparison to the spectacle that unfolds. Bhansali reunites with two of his favourite leads in recent times - Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, but adds Shahid Kapoor to complete this trio of commendable acting talent.\nShahid is steadfast and unflappable as Maharawal Ratan Singh - the ruler of Mewar, brimming with Rajput pride. He brings a regal aura to the character that warrants him winning the confidence and loyalty of the Mewar kingdom and more importantly, Rani Padmavati's heart. Deepika is radiant as the Rajput Queen whose beauty, brains and valour moves the entire plot along once Alauddin Khilji becomes obsessed with her. Padmavati's allure beyond the superficial is prominent post-interval, when her character comes to life and she gets to showcase her acting range. Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji is seen as an unhinged, barbaric Sultan, who is consumed with a ravenous libido for power and flesh. He unleashes an animal magnetism on screen with a scarred face, kohl-lined eyes and a greased torso. The scenes between him and Shahid are some of the most engrossing, as both flex their acting muscles at opposite ends of the moral spectrum. Besides them, Aditi Rao Hydari stands her ground as the naive Mehrunissa who gets a rude awakening when she discovers her husband Alauddin's true nature. Jim Sarbh is somewhat misplaced as the Sultan's slave-general, unable to generate enough menace to overshadow his master's own. Nonetheless, the ensemble moves well in tune with Bhansali's vision of this larger-than-life retelling.\nThe director's expertise in heightening opulence and grandeur is well-known, further distinguishable in 3D. Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee compliments him by beautifully capturing some jaw-dropping scenery. However, the effects in the action/ war scenes don't meet the expectations raised by a film of this scale. Also, the songs don't do much to further the narrative other than providing visual delight. Granted, it could do with a tauter screenplay and shorter run-time but 'Padmaavat' is an entertaining, large canvas experience, brought to life with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's stroke of visual brilliance.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

It is obvious this is a lame attempt to portray a day in the life of a Harvey Weinstein or other deranged Producers - but it fails miserably. Instead it makes Garner look like a delusional pathetic dull personality that has nothing else going on in her life except to be concerned about supposedly alluded to sexual predatory behavior of her boss. But she has no valid proof after only 5 weeks of working as his Assistant. The 2 women I watched the film with also agreed that this was such a lame attempt at such a sensitive subject matter that it should never have been made or at least re written with some substance instead of just insinuations throughout the film. Plus Garner is always in the same exact outfit with pink top and short pants. Could the film not afford to buy her more than one outfit. If you really want to watch endless drawn out meticulously filmed details of what an Assistant does all day then you might feel an ounce of sympathy for the main character who basically is a slave to her job. It would have had more impact if she simply quit the job in the first 30 minutes and end of the short film. Instead it just drags and drags on and ends in the same manner. A waste of time and anyone that tries to write some high profile review like this is a masterpiece that is a day in the life of Hollywood is truly pathetic. What is next.. The Janitor? The driver? Has Hollywood gotten so desperate that this is the type of films female directors want to make to put a mark in their career. Great job directing.. please find a better script next time.

It was made during the time when Slasher films were becoming massively popular. John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" had just released three years earlier, and the original Friday the 13th was released just one year prior. The popularity and cult following of Wes Craven's 1977 \"The Hills Have Eyes\" was likely a major influence on director James Bryan, as the killer in this film looks as though he is a long-lost relative of Papa Jupiter's Clan.The plot of the film (which is VERY thin) revolves around four young campers. The reluctant city boy, Peter (Jack McClelland), his girlfriend Ingrid (Mary Gail Artz), and their two friends Joanie (Angie Brown), and outdoorsman Craig (James P. Hayden). The four trek through the wilderness, apparently trying to reach a cabin somewhere in the woods (they never do reach it, by the way). As they journey through the beautiful mountains, an unseen madman is knocking off other hikers in the woods in various gory ways. He kills a honeymooning couple, a birdwatcher, a mother and son, a man in a wheelchair, and a young artist who is painting the landscape as her infant daughter lingers nearby.Pretty soon, our madman catches up to our four main characters. The killer is revealed to be a deranged wild man, dressed from head-to-toe in animal furs and wielding a nasty-looking sharp spear. Soon enough, he manages to violently kill two of our main heroes, leaving only Peter and Ingrid. Meanwhile, the local Sheriff forms a search party to look for the murdering psychopathic mountain man.Like so many who have seen this film, I can say that the acting is atrociously bad. However, I will note that that is likely because most of the film is dubbed over. Plus, I don't think that the bad acting in this movie ruins the experience. In fact, I think it makes it all the more better. I can never stop laughing every time I watch this movie. It is just a film that makes me feel really good. I know it is strange by saying watching an apparent gory horror movie makes me happy....but truthfully, this film makes me smile bigger than any comedy film can. The sheer absurdity of this film is what really makes this a terrific movie experience. And that is not to say that there are no chilling and pretty brutal moments in the movie. The scene in which Joanie is trapped in the maniac's cabin and desperately tries to escape through a small window as the killer hacks her back to pieces with a machete was quite horrifying and brutal, and I did find myself hoping for her to escape....only to be disappointed.And even though the acting is obviously bad in this film, I did find the main four characters strangely likeable. Unlike most teen slasher flicks with characters going to a specific place for sex and partying, the four in Don't Go in the Woods seem to be going to the woods for a simple adventure away from city life with their main objective to take in all the beautiful sights before the terror begins. Having said that though, the scene in which Craig zips Joanie up in a sleeping bag and begins crying out obscenities was a little odd and seemingly changed his \"serious\" outdoorsman demeanor to a class clown right before he meets his bloody demise at the end of the madman's stick!I really did like Peter as the hero of the film and did find myself rooting for him at the end of the film as he and Ingrid stabbed the maniac to death. I mean, where else are you going to find a horror film hero who takes off his cool pink ripped and torn shirt and stuffs grass inside of it to try and fool the antagonist!Ever since watching this film for the first time in September of 2002, I have never forgotten it. I definitely see the influence it had on films such as the \"Wrong Turn\" franchise. And while those films definitely and undoubtedly used \"Just Before Dawn\" (another 80's classic that was released the same year as this film) as a major influence, I still believe I find a bit of \"Don't Go in the Woods\" being referenced in there subtly.When watching this film now, in 2020 (a full 18 years after I first watched it) I find myself getting that big grin on my face as the opening theme begins. It truly takes me back to my youth. A much simpler time when you could go to the video store, rent a cheesy gory horror flick, and sit back and laugh and get scared by it in the comfort of your living room. A time when you could see a film that never set out to make itself overly serious.Boy.....they sure don't make horror movies the way they used to.", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

Visser begins to feel the pressure from the police commissioner and mayor as they are terrified what these murders will do for the public image and tourism in Amsterdam. Will Visser stop the psychopath?I really like Amsterdamned a lot as a late 80's slasher for many reasons. One, the filming locations. I found the canals and dark alleys/streets surrounding it to be an eerily perfect place for the killer to stalk their victims. Another is that the POV stalking scenes of the killer are top notch. They are done in such a creepy way, Dick Maas deserves a lot of credit for the work on them. They create a lot of on the edge of your seat tension and terror. Also, this movie looks REALLY good for being done in 1988 in terms of picture quality. The one major negative for me was killer reveal and the ending. It all just felt a bit rushed.I highly recommend Amsterdamned to any horror fan. It is a slick and high quality late 80's slasher flick with amazing stalking POV scenes and some gore as well.

That alone pretty much will tell what you will think about this show. If you really like Glee and that feel good tone, then you might really enjoy this! The point of this show is taking a time frame of Hollywood's history and some of its famous actors like Rock Hudson, Hattie Mcdaniel and Anna May Wong, giving essentially a rewrite of history where the industry moved itself forward sooner than we realized. Justice for racism, sexism, sexual assault, are all some common themes Ryan Murphy ties into this piece. So why didn't it work for me? If it sounds so thoughtful why could I dismiss it so easily? Because it doesn't add anything new or interesting to an already ongoing conversation. It seems like Murphy had the intention of making his story inspirational so we can imagine what it would be like if Hollywood did wake itself up, and give everyone their happy endings, but it feels more self congratulatory than an actual analysis. This show is so surface level in how it explores these themes it becomes laughably bad to sit through.I really liked the idea that maybe Rock Hudson got to open himself up and tell the world his real truth but this show is also tackling so many different tones and ideas it becomes inconsistent and self indulgent. Why not focus on Rock Hudson? Or Hattie McDaniels? Instead we have these fantasy characters who represent the basic stock function of progressive stereotypes. I give this series points for its creative production design/ costumes as most period pieces should look this good anyway, but the writing needed more genuine substance. The idea of someone comparing this to Tarantino is very baffling to me because there's not even a comparison of depth in what his film was doing. Tarantino created a masterful tale where the Manson gang became a joke, and Sharon Tate was remembered as a real human being and not just a victim, Murphy's Hollywood is the complete opposite. This is a 16 year old's perception of Hollywood. With no real focus or reason to why these progressive characters get what they want aside from being, well, progressive. The script is lacking, and instead of being a thought provoking story it comes off as a huge pat on the back, to which I say, NICE TRY HOLLYWOOD! 4/10", "helpful": ["18", "36"]},

The central characters (the main three as well as the regular supporting cast) are each compelling in their own unique way, and their conflicts with each other feel real and emotionally believable on the personal, societal, and ideological levels. It's so fun to watch a show that challenges its characters to make plausible, difficult decisions, and every single choice they make impacts the world around them somehow.

Dixon complained for the police, but the sheriff had to find a way to make peace with Hayes while stopping his subordinates from making trouble. But the sheriff's cancer and final self-determination broke the balance and catalysed everything. This sudden death has become a \"material\" for the people in the town to interpret infinitely. Some people think that it is due to the relief of suffering from disease, but more people think that it is suffering from Hayes' humiliation and pressure, more like a decisive counterattack. At the same time, the death has become a strong internal driving force to promote narrative.\nStable start to shake, balanced start to tilt, one corner of the triangle suddenly collapsed, and the other two ends of the game began. And that set off the two fires. As the confrontation in this story reaches its peak, it happens to be the process of both sides entering each other's heart. The sheriff left a letter to everyone, to Hayes and Dixon. His absence turned into a more obvious presence. A confession full of self mockery and humor from the dead was far more powerful than his futile explanation in his life. At this point, the theme set up in \"the good man is hard to find\" has been diluted. Although it is full of violence, all things have finally subsided. The lines on Hayes's face are no longer rigid, and Dixon is no longer so reckless. The angle began to move towards the resultant force. Just like those two fires, seemingly tit for tat revenge, in fact, they are all misunderstandings. After a series of misunderstandings and violence, they accidentally promote reconciliation and softness.\nThis unexpected change is closer to the truth of life, self righteous judgment, irresolvable estrangement, unexpected and unprovoked disaster, unexplained dawn. People think that they are on the right path, but they may go astray. They believe that the mountains are poor and the waters are flowing again, but they run into the dark.\nThere is stupidity and violence in this town, but it's not the inside that the film focuses on. It's all the surface. They are finally peeled off layer by layer. Although there are costs, they have experienced blood and fire, but the final result is actually tempered very softly. It starts with heartbreak and ends with liberation. Everyone has scars, Dixon's on the cheek, Hayes's in the heart, but the two finally look at each other and smile. The ending is destined not to put on another crazy ending, but to \"make decisions on the road\" like life itself.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

After a couple of bit parts it looked like Murphy had no future in front of the camera, but this role was tailor-made for the 24 year old newcomer (certain aspects of his own background built into the script), selected for his Texas heritage as the lead in this grim melodrama produced by the Variety Boys' Club in Copperas Cove, TX, though filming took place at California's Conejo-Janss Ranch north of Los Angeles as \"The Story of Danny Lester.\" Producer Paul Short was guaranteed financing only through Murphy's casting, and judging by the results those who scoffed at his inexperience must have been dazzled by his performance. His Danny Lester is the 'Bad Boy' of the title, a huge rap sheet by age 17, whose most recent scrape, an attempted robbery in a Dallas hotel, results in his being transferred to a ranch for juvenile delinquents run by Lloyd Nolan's Marshall Brown. Eager to throw a punch at the smallest provocation, Danny remains tight lipped and unapologetic toward the other youths, but at least shows a softer side toward Marshall's pretty wife Maud (Jane Wyatt), assigned chores working for her in the kitchen and around the yard. Old habits die hard though, sneaking off into town to steal a cash payment cleverly mailed to himself at the ranch while Marshall calls on Danny's tyrannical stepfather (Rhys Williams) and stepsister (Martha Vickers), who relate an awful story of how the boy killed his own mother and struck his stepfather before setting fire to their home. Digging deeper into the tragedy, he finds out that Danny's former employer (Francis Pierlot) was coerced into blaming Danny for slipping two sleeping pills into his ailing mother's drink by his bible thumping stepfather, whose refusal to allow her any treatment (blaming her illness on the devil) resulted in her death from natural causes. By now it may be too late to save the boy, having stolen a gun and ammunition before driving off in a stolen car for the inevitable showdown with police, then another from his hospital bed with a former partner in crime. The script carefully keeps the odds in Murphy's favor by not allowing his character to sink low enough to kill, and his remarkable performance belies his own low assessment of any acting talent in keeping the viewer off guard as to how dangerous he can be. Jane Wyatt would become typecast as the perfect mother opposite Robert Young on FATHER KNOWS BEST, but for STAR TREK fans she is forever beloved as Spock's Earth mother Amanda in \"Journey to Babel.\"", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

Set in Key West during 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis with JFK usually on TV, solemnly announcing the Russian's approach, there a 14-year-old boy called Gene : Fenton, is preoccupied with the forthcoming visit by B movie filmmaker Lawrence Woolsey : Goodman, accompanied by his leading lady, Ruth Corday : Cathy Moriarty, to promote his new exploiter called \"Mant\" around a chap mutating into ant. As Gene, his brothers and friends prepare for the riotous excitement of Woolsey Matinee preview. While Gene is also worried about his father, stationed in Cuba. \"Mant : Half man, Half ant, All terror!\".This is an attractive and engagingly affectionate satire set on fears located in an American small-town. It builds sly parallels between movie horror and real life by juxtaposing JFK speeching against Woolsey hyping his schlock shown in AtomoVision . The stunning details of the abundant visual and verbal gags make this movie as agreeable. John Goodman gives a very good acting as a botcher promoter extraordinarie, being modeled B movie king William Castle. Along with the splendid but drippy teens dominating too much of the storyline as Simon Fenton, Omri Katz, Kellie Martin.

As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by John Hora. The motion picture was competently directed by Joe Dante in his usual ironic style. This good director who belonged to Roger Corman factory has made some nice and successful films of all kind of genres but with penchant for terror, Sci-Fi and humor, such as : Hollywood Boulevard, Piranha, Twilight zone, Gremlins, Gremlis 2 :The new batch, Explorers, Amazon women on the moon, Innerspace, The burbs, Small soldiers, Looney Tunes back in action.

Or, was that even what we were looking for?It was all misdirection,The things I liked about this season? The locations that they chose. The things I didn't like? Well I prefer 10 episodes to eight episodes, it gives just that much more time to flesh out the story.Although they packed each episode with as much information as they could, sometimes it wasn't very clear exactly what was happening. Earlier we saw that one of Dolores' copies who was hiding inside of Musashi had been storing barrels of the white stuff that they make hosts out of in one of his warehouses.So we know that one of Dolores goals was to prevent the extinction of hosts. But Rehoboam kept on figuring out what she was doing, so then she had to have plans within plans to trick Rehoboam into chasing the white rabbit into nowhere. She had to put its attention on her, when it should have been on Caleb or BernArnold.We have seen some of Maeve's other allies like Clementine (finally!) and Hanaryo acting independently, were they also being coerced by Serac, or were they following their own agenda, and what happened to them? We saw them for a short time... and there never was any more Lee Sizemore, and I had hoped he would factor in sooner or later.So it looks like they are seeding season four.At the very end of season two we see William being interviewed by his daughter for \"Fidelity\", even though we thought she had been shot. And season three confirms that she was... and there is even an explanation of that, of sorts. But who was interviewing who at that time?I guess the entire point was that Dolores had copied herself and put herself into several different hosts, which all gradually diverged from \"The Original\". But we learn something else here, it's not just that Dolores was the original host. She was much more than that.There is so much more going on here, and I am very happy that they have kept up the level of complexity to Westworld standards. And now that we know where Westworld actually is, and all of the other Delos parks, maybe we can move the story back there in season four. After inflicting the world with Delores, Maeve, BernArnold and Halores, the Westworld parks might just be a much safer place...Until next season, then.", "helpful": ["44", "90"]},

The side characters, Nanny and the commander Melanoff feel like a necessary balance to the cynical kids. They are intimidating but kind to the kids. The narration by a despondent blue cat keeps you on the edge of your seat, may it be the disclaimer in the beginning or through all the tragic scenes as the movie advances. The movie is funny and delightful with great visuals, may it be a factory scene at Melanoff's or at the unclimbable Alp. It is a treat to watch with all its rainbow-tinged cinematography and cartoons as pretty as some shiny toys popped just out of a box. The best part of this movie is its film score, may it be the heart-warming song 'I choose', lovely music during the stirring scenes or the upbeat hip-hop that adds all the more fun to the chaotic scenes. The music keeps you engaged in a way you won't even know. If you haven't read the book and expect nothing from this movie, trust me on how this movie has a lot to offer. This uplifting dark comedy is a must watch.", "helpful": ["2", "5"]},

He thinks Barnaby should focus on one of his brother's employees, the restaurant manager, hot-tempered Vince Bradford, who happens to be a now-married former boyfriend of Betty, and the two remain friends. It seems the deceased was always making passes at Bradford's wife, Nora. Another employee, Carl Fenton, saw the two men fighting on the night the owner died and tries to blackmail Bradford but Mrs. Bradford has other plans for Fenton.Betty and Nora meet and some mild tension between the two women becomes apparent. Vince, now under suspicion over his dispute with Rick Lorenzo, tells Betty that he socked Rick in the mouth after a bitter dispute but the man was alive when he left. Nora confesses that she had to take care of matters (i.e. kill Rick and Carl) because Vince does not know how to handle things appropriately. When Betty tries to call the police, Nora takes out a gun and shoots at Betty but misses. Vince tries to grab the gun but gets shot accidentally. It is unclear how seriously he is wounded. Barnaby walks in and disarms Nora, who then begins crying that she never wanted to hurt Vince, whom she has always loved. Betty calls the police.\n*** Final note: The show's performances are fine as always for this series, but Diana Hyland (as Mrs. Nora Bradford), battling the terminal cancer that would claim her life the following year (1977) is frail, which she hides as best she can but her lustrous mettle allows her to still make an impact. Interestingly, Dick Van Patten appears in the episode. Hyland and Van Patten would later star as a married couple in Eight Is Enough (1977), until Hyland was forced to withdraw due to her illness. The show continued and Betty Buckley was cast as the woman who becomes Van Patten's new love interest and second wife.", "helpful": ["1", "1"]},

When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film \"Snowpiercer.\" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described \"Parasite\" as \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.\" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. \"Parasite\" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.", "helpful": ["0", "0"]},

So, like I said, I think the basic framework was there and the setting was good, but it's like the film makers just didn't really have any substantial idea as to what to do with it. And, really, to me anyway, I strongly felt that the acting was by FAR the worst part. Even our dear Ms. Silverstone, the little she was in the movie. But, mostly... really, REALLY bad acting all around. Maybe the children weren't too bad considering the awful writing (something else that really didn't help) but, other than the real effort with the atmosphere and the setting, you just REALLY wish that they had actually done something decent with it, that's all...I guess that is what kind of moved me to bother even to write a review when I really didn't have a whole lot to say. I guess I feel that twinge or longing or something in my heart where I feel that something COULD have honestly been made of this idea and setting, but I truly think that between the poor writing and for some unknown, mysterious reason the film makers' inability somehow to elicit even the barest acceptable performances are really what took this film down hard.Needless to say, although I did feel moved to come here and acknowledge the effort with the mood and such, I honestly cannot really recommend this film at all...", "helpful": ["10", "22"]},

We can all thank them for that.BUT here is what really matters. I do have my issues, however, with this last episode-a theme that has plagued the whole season-too much time is spent not doing much. In the bad batch arc, many of those of just extra shooting or pointless, non character building dialogue, scenes could have trimmed down and made the arc 2 episodes. The Trace/Rafa stuff could have easily been condensed into two episodes. And these last 4 episodes, spent a lot of time building good tension, yet wasted time at moments.You may be thinking, what come on this was great! And yes, it was, but let's be honest with ourselves. With a short 12 episode season, you can't waste one second. The bad batch arc was good yet took way too long, we ain't even gonna mention trace and that arc, and the siege of Mandalore arc was beautifully crafted, yet lost some potential in the end.We wanted Ahsoka and Rex to visit the temple and find Anakin turned Vader, confronting him. We all wanted to see Padme for more than 30 seconds in the start of season 7. We wanted to see the Chancellor get kidnapped on Courscant, yet we just got a hologram message instead. Perhaps we even wanted to see Anakin go into the temple and murk some Jedi, but that didn't happen.That's my slight issue, you spend an already short season using potential moments on episodes you don't need and parts which just take time up, such as the droids in this episode sending the clones up-down (you'll know what I mean if you wattched it) after taking forever, or extending out some hallway shooting scenes. So much more potential to use things for, yet not.The ending scene bumped this last episode up to a 9 from an 8 however.

I binge watched the three seasons in four or five days, that's how much I loved it. The first season was the best, that was a perfect ten to me. Season two and three I score it with an eight. The references to other movies in this series are multiple, and it's a part of what makes it comical. The weird chemistry between the three main characters work perfectly. My favorite character 'Tiger' was played brilliantly by Eliza Coupe. Not only she got the looks but the way she deals violently with problems is just hilarious. 'Wolf' played by Derek Wilson is also very funny. He's the Alpha male and about everything he says is just cracking me up, that was just brilliant. Josh Hutcherson did also a great job playing Josh Futturman, the man supposing to save the world, a bit naive and wanting to do everything without any violence, it just works perfectly in combination with the two 'brutes'. I loved this show and I'm kinda sad there are only three seasons. Even though the quality was better in the beginning I still think they could have made more seasons. It's sometimes a bit difficult to follow, or doesn't make sense at some points, but the comedy level is so high that you just don't care.

And this film confirms that. This story walks a tightrope from early on - a tightrope of credibility, of relationships, of plot progression - and yet, makes it across the abyss, triumphant. From the start Emily Mortimer's character shows such touching and completely unromantic love for her brother-in-law that it sets the film on the right track from the start. The appearance of the girl friend is both touching and hilarious, and often the film's acknowledgement of the cold reality allows for some real humor (as does a minor subplot of workplace conflict which anticipated \"The Office\" - I mean really, what kind of twisted person hangs a... but I digress). Yet, the thrust of the film is the loving support not only of those close to the main character but really of the whole town. In this sense, the film resembles \"Nebraska\" in its affectionate portrayal of small towns where everyone supports each other - no matter how strange the ask. One of the loveliest aspects of this film is how the townspeople go beyond humoring him to really embracing his mute girl friend. With this, all along, is a strong, understated, story of healing, of taking one's time to get where one needs to go. All very confidently, quietly, laid out. Not only should lovers of good acting see this film, but certainly anyone working on a screenplay who wants to see how to expertly show love driving an unexpected story.", "helpful": ["0", "1"]},

My rating 8/10.Bad Education, movie Based on a true story of America's largest school theft, a scandal of 11 million dollars from Roslyn school district. Prime suspects Frank Tassone, Pam Gluckin played by Hugh jackman and Allision Gluckin respectively. Frank Tassone, superintendent of Roslyn district schools who genuinely cares about students, does what's best for their students, remembers everyone's name, and overly concerned about his physical appearance. Pam Glukin is a hardworking, trusted individual. Everything goes smoothly until a student investigates for funds for her school article.Bad Education is absolutely captivating, for some the first 30 min might seem a little boring, in fact, nothing happens, we don't know what's happening it just builds characters and sets environment, after that movie jumps, instantly hooks until the end of the movie, we see another side of the characters, unfolding the story through student journalist.\nThe screenplay how of the story unravels interestingly wrote by Mike Makowsky. After seeing the movie Surprised to know this is an only second directorial film by Cory Finley, did a good job.Hugh jackman Easily the best part of the movie, with his charisma, deep acting, facial expressions, as the movie progresses he changes shades of character really given a masterclass acting. Not only in the movie in real Hugh jackman worked as a teacher, and also remembers his student's name, as we all know how nice is this guy. For me, this is the best acting of Hugh after Les Miserables ( 2012), Prisoners (2013). Alison Janney's performance was amazing.Verdict - A character study of how these two individuals who are reasonably good people, did a bad thing and broke the trust of people brilliantly written and directed. Terrific performance By Hugh Jackman.Bad Education (2020), Drama/biography/thriller\nDirected By Cory Finley, screenplay - Mike Makowsky, he was in middle school in the Roslyn school district during this true scandal took place.\nCast - Hugh jackman, Alison Janney, Geraldine Viswanathan.\nThanks for reading\ud83d\ude43", "helpful": ["8", "13"]},
